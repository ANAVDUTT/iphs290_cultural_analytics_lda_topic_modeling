I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to\\nassure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in\\nthe success of my undertaking.</p>\\n\\n<p>I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets\\nof Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks,\\nwhich braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand\\nthis feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions\\ntowards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy\\nclimes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become\\nmore fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole\\nis the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my\\nimagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret,\\nthe sun is forever visible, its broad disk just skirting the\\nhorizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There&mdash;for with\\nyour leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding\\nnavigators&mdash;there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing\\nover a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders\\nand in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\\nglobe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those\\nundiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of\\neternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which\\nattracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial\\nobservations that require only this voyage to render their seeming\\neccentricities consistent forever. I shall satiate my ardent\\ncuriosity with the sight of a part of the world never before\\nvisited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of\\nman. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer\\nall fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a\\nlittle boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery\\nup his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be\\nfalse, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall\\nconfer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a\\npassage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present\\nso many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the\\nmagnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an\\nundertaking such as mine.</p>\\n\\n<p>These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I\\nbegan my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which\\nelevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to\\ntranquillize the mind as a steady purpose&mdash;a point on which\\nthe soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the\\nfavourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the\\naccounts of the various voyages which have been made in the\\nprospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas\\nwhich surround the pole. You may remember that a history of all the\\nvoyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our\\ngood Uncle Thomas\\' library. My education was neglected, yet I was\\npassionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and\\nnight, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I\\nhad felt, as a child, on learning that my father\\'s dying injunction\\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring\\nlife.</p>\\n\\n<p>These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those\\npoets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I\\nalso became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own\\ncreation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple\\nwhere the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are\\nwell acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the\\ndisappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my\\ncousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their\\nearlier bent.</p>\\n\\n<p>Six years have passed since I resolved on my present\\nundertaking. I can, even now, remember the hour from which I\\ndedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by inuring\\nmy body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several\\nexpeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine,\\nthirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common\\nsailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of\\nmathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical\\nscience from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest\\npractical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate\\nin a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must\\nown I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services. And now, dear\\nMargaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My\\nlife might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred\\nglory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that\\nsome encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage\\nand my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits\\nare often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult\\nvoyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am\\nrequired not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to\\nsustain my own, when theirs are failing.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.\\nThey fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is\\npleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an\\nEnglish stagecoach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped\\nin furs&mdash;a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a\\ngreat difference between walking the deck and remaining seated\\nmotionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from\\nactually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life\\non the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel. I shall\\ndepart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by\\npaying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors\\nas I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the\\nwhale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and\\nwhen shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this\\nquestion? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass\\nbefore you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\\nor never. Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down\\nblessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify\\nmy gratitude for all your love and kindness.</p>\\n\\n<p>Your affectionate brother,<br>\\nR. Walton</p>\\n\\n<h2>Letter 2</h2>\\n\\n<p>Archangel, 28th March, 17&mdash;</p>\\n\\n<p>To Mrs. Saville, England</p>\\n\\n<p>How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost\\nand snow! Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have\\nhired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom\\nI have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and\\nare certainly possessed of dauntless courage.</p>\\n\\n<p>But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy,\\nand the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe\\nevil, I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the\\nenthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if\\nI am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain\\nme in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true;\\nbut that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I\\ndesire the company of a man who could sympathize with me, whose\\neyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister,\\nbut I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me,\\ngentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a\\ncapacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend\\nmy plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor\\nbrother! I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of\\ndifficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am\\nself-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas\\' books of\\nvoyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets\\nof our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my\\npower to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction\\nthat I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more\\nlanguages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight and\\nam in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen. It\\nis true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more\\nextended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it)\\n<i>keeping</i>; and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me\\nto endeavour to regulate my mind. Well, these are useless\\ncomplaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor\\neven here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some\\nfeelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful\\ncourage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather,\\nto word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his\\nprofession. He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and\\nprofessional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of\\nthe noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with\\nhim on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this\\ncity, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise. The master\\nis a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless\\ncourage, made me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in\\nsolitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine\\nfosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I\\ncannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality\\nexercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary,\\nand when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of\\nheart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I\\nheard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who\\nowes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story.\\nSome years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune,\\nand having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of\\nthe girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before\\nthe destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing\\nherself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the\\nsame time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that\\nher father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her\\nlover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a\\nfarm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder\\nof his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with\\nthe remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself\\nsolicited the young woman\\'s father to consent to her marriage with\\nher lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself\\nbound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father\\ninexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that\\nhis former mistress was married according to her inclinations.\\n\"What a noble fellow!\" you will exclaim. He is so; but then he is\\nwholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of\\nignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his\\nconduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and\\nsympathy which otherwise he would command.</p>\\n\\n<p>Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I\\nam wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my\\nvoyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my\\nembarkation. The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring\\npromises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season,\\nso that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do\\nnothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence\\nand considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to\\nmy care.</p>\\n\\n<p>I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of\\nmy undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception\\nof the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with\\nwhich I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions,\\nto \"the land of mist and snow,\" but I shall kill no albatross;\\ntherefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back\\nto you as worn and woeful as the \"Ancient Mariner.\" You will smile\\nat my allusion, but I will disclose a secret. I have often\\nattributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the\\ndangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most\\nimaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul\\nwhich I do not understand. I am practically\\nindustrious&mdash;painstaking, a workman to execute with\\nperseverance and labour&mdash;but besides this there is a love for\\nthe marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my\\nprojects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even\\nto the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore. But to\\nreturn to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern\\ncape of Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I\\ncannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the\\npresent to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your\\nletters on some occasions when I need them most to support my\\nspirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection,\\nshould you never hear from me again.</p>\\n\\n<p>Your affectionate brother,<br>\\nRobert Walton</p>\\n\\n<h2>Letter 3</h2>\\n\\n<p>July 7th, 17&mdash;</p>\\n\\n<p>To Mrs. Saville, England</p>\\n\\n<p>My dear Sister,</p>\\n\\n<p>I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe&mdash;and\\nwell advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a\\nmerchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more\\nfortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many\\nyears. I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold and\\napparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that\\ncontinually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards\\nwhich we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already\\nreached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and\\nalthough not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow\\nus speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to\\nattain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not\\nexpected.</p>\\n\\n<p>No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure\\nin a letter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are\\naccidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record,\\nand I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during\\nour voyage.</p>\\n\\n<p>Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as\\nwell as yours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool,\\npersevering, and prudent.</p>\\n\\n<p>But success <i>shall</i> crown my endeavours. Wherefore not?\\nThus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas,\\nthe very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my\\ntriumph. Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient\\nelement? What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of\\nman?</p>\\n\\n<p>My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I\\nmust finish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!</p>\\n\\n<p>R.W.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Letter 4</h2>\\n\\n<p>August 5th, 17&mdash;</p>\\n\\n<p>To Mrs. Saville, England</p>\\n\\n<p>So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear\\nrecording it, although it is very probable that you will see me\\nbefore these papers can come into your possession.</p>\\n\\n<p>Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which\\nclosed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room\\nin which she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous,\\nespecially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We\\naccordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the\\natmosphere and weather.</p>\\n\\n<p>About two o\\'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld,\\nstretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice,\\nwhich seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my\\nown mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a\\nstrange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our\\nsolicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage,\\nfixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at\\nthe distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man,\\nbut apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided\\nthe dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our\\ntelescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the\\nice. This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we\\nbelieved, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition\\nseemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had\\nsupposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his\\ntrack, which we had observed with the greatest attention. About two\\nhours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\\nnight the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until\\nthe morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose\\nmasses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I\\nprofited of this time to rest for a few hours.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon\\ndeck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel,\\napparently talking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a\\nsledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us\\nin the night on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained\\nalive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were\\npersuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller\\nseemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but\\na European. When I appeared on deck the master said, \"Here is our\\ncaptain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although\\nwith a foreign accent. \"Before I come on board your vessel,\" said\\nhe, \"will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are\\nbound?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question\\naddressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom\\nI should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource\\nwhich he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the\\nearth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of\\ndiscovery towards the northern pole.</p>\\n\\n<p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on\\nboard. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus\\ncapitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been\\nboundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully\\nemaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so\\nwretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but\\nas soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted. We accordingly\\nbrought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by\\nrubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small\\nquantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in\\nblankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. By\\nslow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him\\nwonderfully.</p>\\n\\n<p>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and\\nI often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of\\nunderstanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him\\nto my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would\\npermit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have\\ngenerally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there\\nare moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him\\nor does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is\\nlighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness\\nthat I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and\\ndespairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of\\nthe weight of woes that oppresses him.</p>\\n\\n<p>When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep\\noff the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I\\nwould not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a\\nstate of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon\\nentire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come\\nso far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.</p>\\n\\n<p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest\\ngloom, and he replied, \"To seek one who fled from me.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same\\nfashion?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you\\nup we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the\\nice.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>This aroused the stranger\\'s attention, and he asked a multitude\\nof questions concerning the route which the demon, as he called\\nhim, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said,\\n\"I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of\\nthese good people; but you are too considerate to make\\ninquiries.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in\\nme to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation;\\nyou have benevolently restored me to life.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of\\nthe ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not\\nanswer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken\\nuntil near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a\\nplace of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.\\nFrom this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of\\nthe stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck\\nto watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have\\npersuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to\\nsustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I have promised that someone\\nshould watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object\\nshould appear in sight.</p>\\n\\n<p>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up\\nto the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health\\nbut is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself\\nenters his cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle\\nthat the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had\\nvery little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to\\nlove him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me\\nwith sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in\\nhis better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.\\nI said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find\\nno friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his\\nspirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have\\npossessed as the brother of my heart.</p>\\n\\n<p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at\\nintervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record.</p>\\n\\n<p>August 13th, 17&mdash;</p>\\n\\n<p>My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at\\nonce my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I\\nsee so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the\\nmost poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so\\ncultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with\\nthe choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled\\neloquence. He is now much recovered from his illness and is\\ncontinually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that\\npreceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly\\noccupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in\\nthe projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me on\\nmine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered\\nattentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success\\nand into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure\\nit. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the\\nlanguage of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my\\nsoul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I\\nwould sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the\\nfurtherance of my enterprise. One man\\'s life or death were but a\\nsmall price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I\\nsought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the\\nelemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my\\nlistener\\'s countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to\\nsuppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my\\nvoice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from\\nbetween his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I\\npaused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: \"Unhappy man! Do you\\nshare my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?\\nHear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your\\nlips!\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but\\nthe paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his\\nweakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation\\nwere necessary to restore his composure. Having conquered the\\nviolence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being\\nthe slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he\\nled me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked me\\nthe history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it\\nawakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of\\nfinding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a\\nfellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my\\nconviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not\\nenjoy this blessing. \"I agree with you,\" replied the stranger; \"we\\nare unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better,\\ndearer than ourselves&mdash;such a friend ought to be&mdash;do not\\nlend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once\\nhad a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled,\\ntherefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the\\nworld before you, and have no cause for despair. But I&mdash;I have\\nlost everything and cannot begin life anew.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm,\\nsettled grief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and\\npresently retired to his cabin.</p>\\n\\n<p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than\\nhe does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every\\nsight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the\\npower of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double\\nexistence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by\\ndisappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be\\nlike a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose\\ncircle no grief or folly ventures.</p>\\n\\n<p>Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this\\ndivine wanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been\\ntutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you\\nare therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the\\nmore fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful\\nman. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is\\nwhich he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any\\nother person I ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive\\ndiscernment, a quick but never-failing power of judgment, a\\npenetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and\\nprecision; add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose\\nvaried intonations are soul-subduing music.</p>\\n\\n<p>August 19, 17&mdash;</p>\\n\\n<p>Yesterday the stranger said to me, \"You may easily perceive,\\nCaptain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled\\nmisfortunes. I had determined at one time that the memory of these\\nevils should die with me, but you have won me to alter my\\ndetermination. You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did;\\nand I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not\\nbe a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the\\nrelation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect\\nthat you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the\\nsame dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you\\nmay deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if\\nyou succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure.\\nPrepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous.\\nWere we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter\\nyour unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear\\npossible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke\\nthe laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of\\nnature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series\\ninternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is\\ncomposed.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered\\ncommunication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his\\ngrief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest\\neagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and\\npartly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my\\npower. I expressed these feelings in my answer.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I thank you,\" he replied, \"for your sympathy, but it is\\nuseless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and\\nthen I shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,\" continued\\nhe, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; \"but you are\\nmistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing\\ncan alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive\\nhow irrevocably it is determined.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next\\nday when I should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the\\nwarmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I am not\\nimperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as\\npossible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I\\nshould be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will\\ndoubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know\\nhim, and who hear it from his own lips&mdash;with what interest and\\nsympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I\\ncommence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his\\nlustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I\\nsee his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his\\nface are irradiated by the soul within.</p>\\n\\n<p>Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm\\nwhich embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked\\nit&mdash;thus!</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 1</h2>\\n\\n<p>I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\\ndistinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many\\nyears counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several\\npublic situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by\\nall who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to\\npublic business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by\\nthe affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had\\nprevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life\\nthat he became a husband and the father of a family.</p>\\n\\n<p>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I\\ncannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends\\nwas a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through\\nnumerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was\\nBeaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not\\nbear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he\\nhad formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence.\\nHaving paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he\\nretreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived\\nunknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the\\ntruest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these\\nunfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride\\nwhich led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection\\nthat united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out,\\nwith the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through\\nhis credit and assistance. Beaufort had taken effectual measures to\\nconceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered\\nhis abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house,\\nwhich was situated in a mean street near the Reuss. But when he\\nentered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved\\nbut a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\\nit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months,\\nand in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment\\nin a merchant\\'s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in\\ninaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had\\nleisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his\\nmind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness,\\nincapable of any exertion.</p>\\n\\n<p>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she\\nsaw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and\\nthat there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort\\npossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to\\nsupport her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited\\nstraw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely\\nsufficient to support life.</p>\\n\\n<p>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her\\ntime was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of\\nsubsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in\\nher arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow\\novercame her, and she knelt by Beaufort\\'s coffin weeping bitterly,\\nwhen my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting\\nspirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and\\nafter the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and\\nplaced her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this\\nevent Caroline became his wife.</p>\\n\\n<p>There was a considerable difference between the ages of my\\nparents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in\\nbonds of devoted affection. There was a sense of justice in my\\nfather\\'s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should\\napprove highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had\\nsuffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and\\nso was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a\\nshow of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother,\\ndiffering wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was\\ninspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means\\nof, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had\\nendured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to\\nher. Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her\\nconvenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\\nsheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround\\nher with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her\\nsoft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of\\nher hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone\\nthrough. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their\\nmarriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public\\nfunctions; and immediately after their union they sought the\\npleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest\\nattendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative\\nfor her weakened frame.</p>\\n\\n<p>From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest\\nchild, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in\\ntheir rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much\\nas they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw\\ninexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to\\nbestow them upon me. My mother\\'s tender caresses and my father\\'s\\nsmile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first\\nrecollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\\nbetter&mdash;their child, the innocent and helpless creature\\nbestowed on them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose\\nfuture lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery,\\naccording as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep\\nconsciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had\\ngiven life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated\\nboth, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant\\nlife I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of\\nself-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\\none train of enjoyment to me. For a long time I was their only\\ncare. My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I\\ncontinued their single offspring. When I was about five years old,\\nwhile making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they\\npassed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent\\ndisposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This,\\nto my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\\npassion&mdash;remembering what she had suffered, and how she had\\nbeen relieved&mdash;for her to act in her turn the guardian angel\\nto the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the\\nfoldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly\\ndisconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered\\nabout it spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day, when my\\nfather had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me,\\nvisited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working,\\nbent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five\\nhungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother\\nfar above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four\\nothers were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin\\nand very fair. Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite\\nthe poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction\\non her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless,\\nand her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of\\nsensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without\\nlooking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and\\nbearing a celestial stamp in all her features. The peasant woman,\\nperceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on\\nthis lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not her\\nchild, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a\\nGerman and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed\\nwith these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They\\nhad not been long married, and their eldest child was but just\\nborn. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed\\nin the memory of the antique glory of Italy&mdash;one among the\\nschiavi ognor frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty\\nof his country. He became the victim of its weakness. Whether he\\nhad died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not\\nknown. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and\\na beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in\\ntheir rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved\\nbrambles. When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with\\nme in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured\\ncherub&mdash;a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks\\nand whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the\\nhills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my\\nmother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to\\nher. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a\\nblessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in\\npoverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful\\nprotection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was\\nthat Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents\\'\\nhouse&mdash;my more than sister&mdash;the beautiful and adored\\ncompanion of all my occupations and my pleasures.</p>\\n\\n<p>Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential\\nattachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it,\\nmy pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being\\nbrought to my home, my mother had said playfully, \"I have a pretty\\npresent for my Victor&mdash;tomorrow he shall have it.\" And when,\\non the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift,\\nI, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and\\nlooked upon Elizabeth as mine&mdash;mine to protect, love, and\\ncherish. All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a\\npossession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name\\nof cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of\\nrelation in which she stood to me&mdash;my more than sister, since\\ntill death she was to be mine only.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 2</h2>\\n\\n<p>We were brought up together; there was not quite a year\\ndifference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to\\nany species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our\\ncompanionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our\\ncharacters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and\\nmore concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was\\ncapable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten\\nwith the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following\\nthe aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous\\nscenes which surrounded our Swiss home&mdash;the sublime shapes of\\nthe mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the\\nsilence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine\\nsummers&mdash;she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit\\nthe magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating\\ntheir causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to\\ndivine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of\\nnature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are\\namong the earliest sensations I can remember.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my\\nparents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves\\nin their native country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a\\ncampagne on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance\\nof rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally\\nin the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in\\nconsiderable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to\\nattach myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to\\nmy school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of\\nthe closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval was the son\\nof a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy.\\nHe loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake. He\\nwas deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He composed\\nheroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\\nknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the\\nhands of the infidels.</p>\\n\\n<p>No human being could have passed a happier childhood than\\nmyself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness\\nand indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our\\nlot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all\\nthe many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other\\nfamilies I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot\\nwas, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.</p>\\n\\n<p>My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but\\nby some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish\\npursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all\\nthings indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of\\nlanguages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various\\nstates possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven\\nand earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward\\nsubstance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the\\nmysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were\\ndirected to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical\\nsecrets of the world.</p>\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\\nrelations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,\\nand the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream\\nwas to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as\\nthe gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly\\nsoul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our\\npeaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice,\\nthe sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless\\nand animate us. She was the living spirit of love to soften and\\nattract; I might have become sullen in my study, rought through the\\nardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a\\nsemblance of her own gentleness. And Clerval&mdash;could aught ill\\nentrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet he might not have been\\nso perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of\\nkindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit,\\nhad she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and\\nmade the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.</p>\\n\\n<p>I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of\\nchildhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its\\nbright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow\\nreflections upon self. Besides, in drawing the picture of my early\\ndays, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to\\nmy after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the\\nbirth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it\\narise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten\\nsources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent\\nwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys. Natural\\nphilosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\\npredilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we\\nall went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the\\ninclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to\\nthe inn. In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of\\nCornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he\\nattempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates\\nsoon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to\\ndawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my\\ndiscovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title\\npage of my book and said, \"Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor,\\ndo not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to\\nexplain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely\\nexploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced\\nwhich possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the\\npowers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former\\nwere real and practical, under such circumstances I should\\ncertainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my\\nimagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to\\nmy former studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas\\nwould never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.\\nBut the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means\\nassured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I\\ncontinued to read with the greatest avidity. When I returned home\\nmy first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and\\nafterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied\\nthe wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me\\ntreasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as\\nalways having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the\\nsecrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful\\ndiscoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies\\ndiscontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have\\navowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great\\nand unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each\\nbranch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared\\neven to my boy\\'s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same\\npursuit.</p>\\n\\n<p>The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was\\nacquainted with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher\\nknew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but\\nher immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might\\ndissect, anatomize, and give names; but, not to speak of a final\\ncause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly\\nunknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments\\nthat seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of\\nnature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.</p>\\n\\n<p>But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper\\nand knew more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I\\nbecame their disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise\\nin the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of\\neducation in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree,\\nself-taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was not\\nscientific, and I was left to struggle with a child\\'s blindness,\\nadded to a student\\'s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my\\nnew preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the\\nsearch of the philosopher\\'s stone and the elixir of life; but the\\nlatter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an inferior\\nobject, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish\\ndisease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but\\na violent death! Nor were these my only visions. The raising of\\nghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite\\nauthors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my\\nincantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure\\nrather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill\\nor fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was occupied\\nby exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand\\ncontradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough\\nof multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and\\nchildish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of\\nmy ideas. When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our\\nhouse near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible\\nthunderstorm. It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and\\nthe thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various\\nquarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted,\\nwatching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the\\ndoor, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and\\nbeautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so\\nsoon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and\\nnothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next\\nmorning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was\\nnot splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons\\nof wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.</p>\\n\\n<p>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of\\nelectricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural\\nphilosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered\\non the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject\\nof electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing\\nto me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius\\nAgrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my\\nimagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men\\ndisinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as\\nif nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long\\nengaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those\\ncaprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early\\nyouth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural\\nhistory and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation,\\nand entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which\\ncould never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In\\nthis mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the\\nbranches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon\\nsecure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight\\nligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it\\nseems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and\\nwill was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my\\nlife&mdash;the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to\\navert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready\\nto envelop me. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity\\nand gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient\\nand latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be\\ntaught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with\\ntheir disregard.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was\\nineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had\\ndecreed my utter and terrible destruction.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 3</h2>\\n\\n<p>When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved\\nthat I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I\\nhad hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought\\nit necessary for the completion of my education that I should be\\nmade acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.\\nMy departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the\\nday resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life\\noccurred&mdash;an omen, as it were, of my future misery. Elizabeth\\nhad caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was\\nin the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been\\nurged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She\\nhad at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the\\nlife of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her\\nanxiety. She attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions\\ntriumphed over the malignity of the distemper&mdash;Elizabeth was\\nsaved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her\\npreserver. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was\\naccompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her\\nmedical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her deathbed\\nthe fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert\\nher. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. \"My children,\"\\nshe said, \"my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the\\nprospect of your union. This expectation will now be the\\nconsolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my\\nplace to my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from\\nyou; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit\\nyou all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour\\nto resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of\\nmeeting you in another world.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in\\ndeath. I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties\\nare rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents\\nitself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the\\ncountenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that\\nshe whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part\\nof our own can have departed forever&mdash;that the brightness of a\\nbeloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so\\nfamiliar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard.\\nThese are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of\\ntime proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of\\ngrief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away\\nsome dear connection? And why should I describe a sorrow which all\\nhave felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives when grief is\\nrather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays\\nupon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not\\nbanished. My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we\\nought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and\\nlearn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the\\nspoiler has not seized.</p>\\n\\n<p>My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these\\nevents, was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a\\nrespite of some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave\\nthe repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush\\ninto the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the\\nless alarm me. I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that\\nremained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth\\nin some degree consoled.</p>\\n\\n<p>She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to\\nus all. She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with\\ncourage and zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been\\ntaught to call her uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting\\nas at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and\\nspent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her\\nendeavours to make us forget.</p>\\n\\n<p>The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the\\nlast evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to\\npermit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in\\nvain. His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and\\nruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt\\nthe misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said\\nlittle, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his\\nanimated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to\\nthe miserable details of commerce.</p>\\n\\n<p>We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other\\nnor persuade ourselves to say the word \"Farewell!\" It was said, and\\nwe retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that\\nthe other was deceived; but when at morning\\'s dawn I descended to\\nthe carriage which was to convey me away, they were all\\nthere&mdash;my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand\\nonce more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write\\noften and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate\\nand friend.</p>\\n\\n<p>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and\\nindulged in the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been\\nsurrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in\\nendeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure&mdash;I was now alone. In\\nthe university whither I was going I must form my own friends and\\nbe my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded\\nand domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new\\ncountenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these\\nwere \"old familiar faces,\" but I believed myself totally unfitted\\nfor the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I\\ncommenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes\\nrose. I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often,\\nwhen at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up\\nin one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station\\namong other human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it\\nwould, indeed, have been folly to repent.</p>\\n\\n<p>I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections\\nduring my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At\\nlength the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted\\nand was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as\\nI pleased.</p>\\n\\n<p>The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid\\na visit to some of the principal professors. Chance&mdash;or rather\\nthe evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted\\nomnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps\\nfrom my father\\'s door&mdash;led me first to M. Krempe, professor of\\nnatural philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the\\nsecrets of his science. He asked me several questions concerning my\\nprogress in the different branches of science appertaining to\\nnatural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt,\\nmentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had\\nstudied. The professor stared. \"Have you,\" he said, \"really spent\\nyour time in studying such nonsense?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I replied in the affirmative. \"Every minute,\" continued M.\\nKrempe with warmth, \"every instant that you have wasted on those\\nbooks is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory\\nwith exploded systems and useless names. Good God! In what desert\\nland have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you\\nthat these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a\\nthousand years old and as musty as they are ancient? I little\\nexpected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a\\ndisciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must\\nbegin your studies entirely anew.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several\\nbooks treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to\\nprocure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of\\nthe following week he intended to commence a course of lectures\\nupon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M.\\nWaldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the\\nalternate days that he omitted.</p>\\n\\n<p>I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had\\nlong considered those authors useless whom the professor\\nreprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to\\nthese studies in any shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a\\ngruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore,\\ndid not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too\\nphilosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an\\naccount of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my\\nearly years. As a child I had not been content with the results\\npromised by the modern professors of natural science. With a\\nconfusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and\\nmy want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of\\nknowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of\\nrecent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. Besides, I\\nhad a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was\\nvery different when the masters of the science sought immortality\\nand power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the\\nscene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\\nitself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in\\nscience was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of\\nboundless grandeur for realities of little worth.</p>\\n\\n<p>Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of\\nmy residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\\nacquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my\\nnew abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the\\ninformation which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.\\nAnd although I could not consent to go and hear that little\\nconceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected\\nwhat he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had\\nhitherto been out of town.</p>\\n\\n<p>Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the\\nlecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This\\nprofessor was very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty\\nyears of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest\\nbenevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the\\nback of his head were nearly black. His person was short but\\nremarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He\\nbegan his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry\\nand the various improvements made by different men of learning,\\npronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished\\ndiscoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of\\nthe science and explained many of its elementary terms. After\\nhaving made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a\\npanegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never\\nforget: \"The ancient teachers of this science,\" said he, \"promised\\nimpossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters promise\\nvery little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that\\nthe elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands\\nseem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the\\nmicroscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They\\npenetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her\\nhiding-places. They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered\\nhow the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.\\nThey have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can\\ncommand the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock\\nthe invisible world with its own shadows.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Such were the professor\\'s words&mdash;rather let me say such the\\nwords of the fate&mdash;enounced to destroy me. As he went on I\\nfelt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one\\nthe various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my\\nbeing; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled\\nwith one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has been\\ndone, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein&mdash;more, far more, will\\nI achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a\\nnew way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the\\ndeepest mysteries of creation.</p>\\n\\n<p>I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a\\nstate of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence\\narise, but I had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the\\nmorning\\'s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight\\'s thoughts\\nwere as a dream. There only remained a resolution to return to my\\nancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I\\nbelieved myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day I paid\\nM. Waldman a visit. His manners in private were even more mild and\\nattractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his\\nmien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the\\ngreatest affability and kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same\\naccount of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow\\nprofessor. He heard with attention the little narration concerning\\nmy studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and\\nParacelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited.\\nHe said that \"These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern\\nphilosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\\nknowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new\\nnames and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they\\nin a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.\\nThe labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed,\\nscarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of\\nmankind.\" I listened to his statement, which was delivered without\\nany presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had\\nremoved my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself\\nin measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth\\nto his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life\\nwould have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated\\nmy intended labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I\\nought to procure.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I am happy,\" said M. Waldman, \"to have gained a disciple; and\\nif your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your\\nsuccess. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which\\nthe greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that\\naccount that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same\\ntime, I have not neglected the other branches of science. A man\\nwould make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that\\ndepartment of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become\\nreally a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I\\nshould advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy,\\nincluding mathematics.\" He then took me into his laboratory and\\nexplained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as\\nto what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when\\nI should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange\\ntheir mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had\\nrequested, and I took my leave.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future\\ndestiny.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 4</h2>\\n\\n<p>From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in\\nthe most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole\\noccupation. I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and\\ndiscrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these\\nsubjects. I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance\\nof the men of science of the university, and I found even in M.\\nKrempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined,\\nit is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on\\nthat account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true\\nfriend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his\\ninstructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature\\nthat banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways he\\nsmoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\\ninquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was\\nat first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I\\nproceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often\\ndisappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my\\nlaboratory.</p>\\n\\n<p>As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my\\nprogress was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the\\nstudents, and my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe\\noften asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on,\\nwhilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my\\nprogress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no\\nvisit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of\\nsome discoveries which I hoped to make. None but those who have\\nexperienced them can conceive of the enticements of science. In\\nother studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and\\nthere is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is\\ncontinual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of moderate\\ncapacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at\\ngreat proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the\\nattainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in\\nthis, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some\\ndiscoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which\\nprocured me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I\\nhad arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with\\nthe theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the\\nlessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there\\nbeing no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of\\nreturning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\\nhappened that protracted my stay.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention\\nwas the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal\\nendued with life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle\\nof life proceed? It was a bold question, and one which has ever\\nbeen considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon\\nthe brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did\\nnot restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my\\nmind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly\\nto those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology.\\nUnless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my\\napplication to this study would have been irksome and almost\\nintolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have\\nrecourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy,\\nbut this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay\\nand corruption of the human body. In my education my father had\\ntaken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed\\nwith no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have\\ntrembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition\\nof a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard\\nwas to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which,\\nfrom being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the\\nworm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay\\nand forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses.\\nMy attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to\\nthe delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the fine form of man\\nwas degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed\\nto the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the\\nwonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and analysing all\\nthe minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life\\nto death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness\\na sudden light broke in upon me&mdash;a light so brilliant and\\nwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the\\nimmensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised\\nthat among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries\\ntowards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to\\ndiscover so astonishing a secret.</p>\\n\\n<p>Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun\\ndoes not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now\\naffirm is true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages\\nof the discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights\\nof incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the\\ncause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of\\nbestowing animation upon lifeless matter.</p>\\n\\n<p>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this\\ndiscovery soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much\\ntime spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my\\ndesires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this\\ndiscovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which\\nI had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld\\nonly the result. What had been the study and desire of the wisest\\nmen since the creation of the world was now within my grasp. Not\\nthat, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the\\ninformation I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my\\nendeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my\\nsearch than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like\\nthe Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage\\nto life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual\\nlight.</p>\\n\\n<p>I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\\nexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret\\nwith which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until\\nthe end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved\\nupon that subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as\\nI then was, to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from\\nme, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is\\nthe acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who\\nbelieves his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to\\nbecome greater than his nature will allow.</p>\\n\\n<p>When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I\\nhesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should\\nemploy it. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing\\nanimation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all\\nits intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a\\nwork of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first\\nwhether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or\\none of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much\\nexalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to\\ngive life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The\\nmaterials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to\\nso arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\\nultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses;\\nmy operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be\\nimperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day\\ntakes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my\\npresent attempts would at least lay the foundations of future\\nsuccess. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my\\nplan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with these\\nfeelings that I began the creation of a human being. As the\\nminuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I\\nresolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a\\ngigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and\\nproportionably large. After having formed this determination and\\nhaving spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging\\nmy materials, I began.</p>\\n\\n<p>No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me\\nonwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life\\nand death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break\\nthrough, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new\\nspecies would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and\\nexcellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could\\nclaim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve\\ntheirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could\\nbestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time\\n(although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had\\napparently devoted the body to corruption.</p>\\n\\n<p>These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my\\nundertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with\\nstudy, and my person had become emaciated with confinement.\\nSometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I\\nclung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might\\nrealize. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I\\nhad dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours,\\nwhile, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to\\nher hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil\\nas I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured\\nthe living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now\\ntremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a\\nresistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to\\nhave lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was\\nindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\\nacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I\\nhad returned to my old habits. I collected bones from\\ncharnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous\\nsecrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell,\\nat the top of the house, and separated from all the other\\napartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy\\ncreation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending\\nto the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the\\nslaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my\\nhuman nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still\\nurged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my\\nwork near to a conclusion.</p>\\n\\n<p>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and\\nsoul, in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the\\nfields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more\\nluxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of\\nnature. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes\\naround me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many\\nmiles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my\\nsilence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my\\nfather: \"I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will\\nthink of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you.\\nYou must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your\\ncorrespondence as a proof that your other duties are equally\\nneglected.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I knew well therefore what would be my father\\'s feelings, but I\\ncould not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself,\\nbut which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I\\nwished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my\\nfeelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up\\nevery habit of my nature, should be completed.</p>\\n\\n<p>I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my\\nneglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced\\nthat he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether\\nfree from blame. A human being in perfection ought always to\\npreserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a\\ntransitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that\\nthe pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study\\nto which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your\\naffections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in\\nwhich no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly\\nunlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this\\nrule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever\\nto interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections,\\nGreece had not been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his country,\\nAmerica would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires\\nof Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.</p>\\n\\n<p>But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part\\nof my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed. My father made no\\nreproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by\\ninquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.\\nWinter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did\\nnot watch the blossom or the expanding leaves&mdash;sights which\\nbefore always yielded me supreme delight&mdash;so deeply was I\\nengrossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year had withered\\nbefore my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me\\nmore plainly how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was\\nchecked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by\\nslavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than\\nan artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was\\noppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful\\ndegree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow\\ncreatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew\\nalarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of\\nmy purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I\\nbelieved that exercise and amusement would then drive away\\nincipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my\\ncreation should be complete.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 5</h2>\\n\\n<p>It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the\\naccomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to\\nagony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might\\ninfuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my\\nfeet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally\\nagainst the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the\\nglimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye\\nof the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion\\nagitated its limbs.</p>\\n\\n<p>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how\\ndelineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had\\nendeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had\\nselected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His\\nyellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries\\nbeneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth\\nof a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more\\nhorrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the\\nsame colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his\\nshrivelled complexion and straight black lips.</p>\\n\\n<p>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the\\nfeelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years,\\nfor the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For\\nthis I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it\\nwith an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had\\nfinished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror\\nand disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the\\nbeing I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long\\ntime traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.\\nAt length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured,\\nand I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a\\nfew moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain; I slept, indeed,\\nbut I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw\\nElizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of\\nIngolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I\\nimprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the\\nhue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\\nheld the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped\\nher form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the\\nflannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my\\nforehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed;\\nwhen, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way\\nthrough the window shutters, I beheld the wretch&mdash;the\\nmiserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the\\nbed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me.\\nHis jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a\\ngrin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear;\\none hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped\\nand rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to\\nthe house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of\\nthe night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening\\nattentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to\\nannounce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so\\nmiserably given life.</p>\\n\\n<p>Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A\\nmummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that\\nwretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but\\nwhen those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it\\nbecame a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.</p>\\n\\n<p>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so\\nquickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at\\nothers, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme\\nweakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of\\ndisappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for\\nso long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so\\nrapid, the overthrow so complete!</p>\\n\\n<p>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my\\nsleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white\\nsteeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter\\nopened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum,\\nand I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if\\nI sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the\\nstreet would present to my view. I did not dare return to the\\napartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on,\\nalthough drenched by the rain which poured from a black and\\ncomfortless sky.</p>\\n\\n<p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring\\nby bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I\\ntraversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was\\nor what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear,\\nand I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about\\nme:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>Like one who, on a lonely road,<br>\\nDoth walk in fear and dread,<br>\\nAnd, having once turned round, walks on,<br>\\nAnd turns no more his head;<br>\\nBecause he knows a frightful fiend<br>\\nDoth close behind him tread.<br>\\n<br>\\n[Coleridge\\'s \"Ancient Mariner.\"]</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which\\nthe various diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I\\npaused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes\\nfixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of\\nthe street. As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss\\ndiligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door\\nbeing opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,\\ninstantly sprung out. \"My dear Frankenstein,\" exclaimed he, \"how\\nglad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at the\\nvery moment of my alighting!\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence\\nbrought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those\\nscenes of home so dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and\\nin a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and\\nfor the first time during many months, calm and serene joy. I\\nwelcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we\\nwalked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for some time\\nabout our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being\\npermitted to come to Ingolstadt. \"You may easily believe,\" said he,\\n\"how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all\\nnecessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of\\nbook-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the\\nlast, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the\\nsame as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield:\\n\\'I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily\\nwithout Greek.\\' But his affection for me at length overcame his\\ndislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage\\nof discovery to the land of knowledge.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how\\nyou left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear\\nfrom you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon\\ntheir account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,\" continued he,\\nstopping short and gazing full in my face, \"I did not before remark\\nhow very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had\\nbeen watching for several nights.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in\\none occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as\\nyou see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments\\nare now at an end and that I am at length free.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far\\nless to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked\\nwith a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then\\nreflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I\\nhad left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking\\nabout. I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more\\nthat Henry should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to remain a\\nfew minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own\\nroom. My hand was already on the lock of the door before I\\nrecollected myself. I then paused, and a cold shivering came over\\nme. I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to\\ndo when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the\\nother side; but nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the\\napartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous\\nguest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could\\nhave befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had\\nindeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to\\nClerval.</p>\\n\\n<p>We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought\\nbreakfast; but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only\\nthat possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of\\nsensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain\\nfor a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs,\\nclapped my hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my\\nunusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more\\nattentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not\\naccount, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened\\nand astonished him.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"My dear Victor,\" cried he, \"what, for God\\'s sake, is the\\nmatter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the\\ncause of all this?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Do not ask me,\" cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I\\nthought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; \"<i>He</i>\\ncan tell. Oh, save me! Save me!\" I imagined that the monster seized\\nme; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.</p>\\n\\n<p>Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which\\nhe anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.\\nBut I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did\\nnot recover my senses for a long, long time.</p>\\n\\n<p>This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me\\nfor several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I\\nafterwards learned that, knowing my father\\'s advanced age and\\nunfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would\\nmake Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent\\nof my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and\\nattentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my\\nrecovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he\\nperformed the kindest action that he could towards them.</p>\\n\\n<p>But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the\\nunbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have\\nrestored me to life. The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed\\nexistence was forever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly\\nconcerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first\\nbelieved them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but\\nthe pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same\\nsubject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to\\nsome uncommon and terrible event.</p>\\n\\n<p>By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed\\nand grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I\\nbecame capable of observing outward objects with any kind of\\npleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and\\nthat the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded\\nmy window. It was a divine spring, and the season contributed\\ngreatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and\\naffection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short\\ntime I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal\\npassion.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Dearest Clerval,\" exclaimed I, \"how kind, how very good you are\\nto me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you\\npromised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I\\never repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment\\nof which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself,\\nbut get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good\\nspirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an\\nobject on whom I dared not even think? \"Compose yourself,\" said\\nClerval, who observed my change of colour, \"I will not mention it\\nif it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy\\nif they received a letter from you in your own handwriting. They\\nhardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long\\nsilence.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first\\nthought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love\\nand who are so deserving of my love?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be\\nglad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it\\nis from your cousin, I believe.\"</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 6</h2>\\n\\n<p>Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from\\nmy own Elizabeth:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\"My dearest Cousin,<br>\\n<br>\\n\"You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear\\nkind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You\\nare forbidden to write&mdash;to hold a pen; yet one word from you,\\ndear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long\\ntime I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my\\npersuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to\\nIngolstadt. I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences\\nand perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I\\nregretted not being able to perform it myself! I figure to myself\\nthat the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some\\nmercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister\\nto them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. Yet that\\nis over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. I\\neagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your\\nown handwriting.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"Get well&mdash;and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful\\nhome and friends who love you dearly. Your father\\'s health is\\nvigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you\\nare well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent\\ncountenance. How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of\\nour Ernest! He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit. He\\nis desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service,\\nbut we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother\\nreturns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military\\ncareer in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of\\napplication. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is\\nspent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. I\\nfear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and\\npermit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has\\ntaken place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad\\nmountains&mdash;they never change; and I think our placid home and\\nour contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws. My\\ntrifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am\\nrewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces\\naround me. Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our\\nlittle household. Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz\\nentered our family? Probably you do not; I will relate her history,\\ntherefore in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow\\nwith four children, of whom Justine was the third. This girl had\\nalways been the favourite of her father, but through a strange\\nperversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of\\nM. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when\\nJustine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow\\nher to live at our house. The republican institutions of our\\ncountry have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\\nprevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is\\nless distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants;\\nand the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their\\nmanners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not\\nmean the same thing as a servant in France and England. Justine,\\nthus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a\\ncondition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the\\nidea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human\\nbeing.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\\nrecollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one\\nglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\\nAriosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica&mdash;she looked so\\nfrank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for\\nher, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to\\nthat which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully\\nrepaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world:\\nI do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass\\nher lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her\\nprotectress. Although her disposition was gay and in many respects\\ninconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture\\nof my aunt. She thought her the model of all excellence and\\nendeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even\\nnow she often reminds me of her.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their\\nown grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her\\nillness with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill;\\nbut other trials were reserved for her.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\\nexception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The\\nconscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\\ndeaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise\\nher partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her\\nconfessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly,\\na few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was\\ncalled home by her repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she\\nquitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt;\\ngrief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners,\\nwhich had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her\\nresidence at her mother\\'s house of a nature to restore her gaiety.\\nThe poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. She\\nsometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much\\noftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and\\nsister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a\\ndecline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now\\nat peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,\\nat the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to\\nus; and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and\\ngentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and\\nher expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little\\ndarling William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his\\nage, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling\\nhair. When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek,\\nwhich are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little\\n<i>wives</i>, but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little\\ngirl of five years of age.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little\\ngossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss\\nMansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her\\napproaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.\\nHer ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last\\nautumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered\\nseveral misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But\\nhe has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the\\npoint of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.\\nShe is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much\\nadmired, and a favourite with everybody.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my\\nanxiety returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest\\nVictor,&mdash;one line&mdash;one word will be a blessing to us. Ten\\nthousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his\\nmany letters; we are sincerely grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take\\ncare of your self; and, I entreat you, write!<br>\\n<br>\\n\"Elizabeth Lavenza.<br>\\n\"Geneva, March 18, 17&mdash;.\"</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>\"Dear, dear Elizabeth!\" I exclaimed, when I had read her letter:\\n\"I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must\\nfeel.\" I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my\\nconvalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another\\nfortnight I was able to leave my chamber.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval\\nto the several professors of the university. In doing this, I\\nunderwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my\\nmind had sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my\\nlabours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a\\nviolent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. When I\\nwas otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical\\ninstrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry\\nsaw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He had\\nalso changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a\\ndislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But\\nthese cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the\\nprofessors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with\\nkindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the\\nsciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not\\nguessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and\\nchanged the subject from my improvement, to the science itself,\\nwith a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I\\ndo? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had\\nplaced carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which\\nwere to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.\\nI writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.\\nClerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning\\nthe sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in\\nexcuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more\\ngeneral turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not\\nspeak. I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted\\nto draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture\\nof affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never\\npersuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often\\npresent to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to\\nanother would only impress more deeply.</p>\\n\\n<p>M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that\\ntime, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt\\nencomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of\\nM. Waldman. \"D&mdash;n the fellow!\" cried he; \"why, M. Clerval, I\\nassure you he has outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it\\nis nevertheless true. A youngster who, but a few years ago,\\nbelieved in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now\\nset himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon\\npulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.&mdash;Ay, ay,\"\\ncontinued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, \"M.\\nFrankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young\\nmen should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was\\nmyself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily\\nturned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to\\nme.</p>\\n\\n<p>Clerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science;\\nand his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had\\noccupied me. He came to the university with the design of making\\nhimself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he\\nshould open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for\\nhimself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his\\neyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of\\nenterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his\\nattention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies.\\nIdleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly\\nfrom reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief\\nin being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only\\ninstruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did\\nnot, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\\nI did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\\namusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\\nrepaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\\nelevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors\\nof any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to\\nconsist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,&mdash;in the smiles\\nand frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own\\nheart. How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece\\nand Rome!</p>\\n\\n<p>Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva\\nwas fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by\\nseveral accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed\\nimpassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I\\nfelt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town\\nand my beloved friends. My return had only been delayed so long,\\nfrom an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before\\nhe had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter,\\nhowever, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was\\nuncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its\\ndilatoriness.</p>\\n\\n<p>The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the\\nletter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry\\nproposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I\\nmight bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long\\ninhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond\\nof exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in\\nthe ramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my\\nnative country.</p>\\n\\n<p>We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and\\nspirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength\\nfrom the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our\\nprogress, and the conversation of my friend. Study had before\\nsecluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and\\nrendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings\\nof my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and\\nthe cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely you\\ndid love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a\\nlevel with your own. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me,\\nuntil your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I\\nbecame the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and\\nbeloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature\\nhad the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A\\nserene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present\\nseason was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the\\nhedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I was\\nundisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed\\nupon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an\\ninvincible burden.</p>\\n\\n<p>Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my\\nfeelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the\\nsensations that filled his soul. The resources of his mind on this\\noccasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of\\nimagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic\\nwriters, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion. At other\\ntimes he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into\\narguments, which he supported with great ingenuity. We returned to\\nour college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and\\nevery one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were high,\\nand I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and\\nhilarity.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 7</h2>\\n\\n<p>On my return, I found the following letter from my\\nfather:&mdash;</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\"My dear Victor,<br>\\n<br>\\n\"You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date\\nof your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a\\nfew lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.\\nBut that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What\\nwould be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad\\nwelcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And\\nhow, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have\\nrendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I\\ninflict pain on my long absent son? I wish to prepare you for the\\nwoeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims\\nover the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the\\nhorrible tidings.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"William is dead!&mdash;that sweet child, whose smiles delighted\\nand warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is\\nmurdered!<br>\\n<br>\\n\"I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the\\ncircumstances of the transaction.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went\\nto walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we\\nprolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before\\nwe thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and\\nErnest, who had gone on before, were not to be found. We\\naccordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently\\nErnest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that\\nhe had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide\\nhimself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited\\nfor a long time, but that he did not return.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him\\nuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have\\nreturned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with\\ntorches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had\\nlost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;\\nElizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning\\nI discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen\\nblooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and\\nmotionless; the print of the murder\\'s finger was on his neck.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my\\ncountenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest\\nto see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she\\npersisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the\\nneck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, \\'O God! I\\nhave murdered my darling child!\\'<br>\\n<br>\\n\"She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she\\nagain lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that\\nsame evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable\\nminiature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone,\\nand was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the\\ndeed. We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to\\ndiscover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved\\nWilliam!<br>\\n<br>\\n\"Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps\\ncontinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his\\ndeath; her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not\\nthat be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our\\ncomforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she\\ndid not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest\\ndarling!<br>\\n<br>\\n\"Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the\\nassassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will\\nheal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the\\nhouse of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for\\nthose who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"Your affectionate and afflicted father,<br>\\n\"Alphonse Frankenstein.<br>\\n\"Geneva, May 12th, 17&mdash;.\"</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter,\\nwas surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at\\nfirst expressed on receiving new from my friends. I threw the\\nletter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"My dear Frankenstein,\" exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me\\nweep with bitterness, \"are you always to be unhappy? My dear\\nfriend, what has happened?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down\\nthe room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the\\neyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I can offer you no consolation, my friend,\" said he; \"your\\ndisaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the\\nhorses.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of\\nconsolation; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. \"Poor\\nWilliam!\" said he, \"dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel\\nmother! Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young\\nbeauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die so miserably;\\nto feel the murderer\\'s grasp! How much more a murdered that could\\ndestroy radiant innocence! Poor little fellow! one only consolation\\nhave we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The pang is\\nover, his sufferings are at an end for ever. A sod covers his\\ngentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a subject\\nfor pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words\\nimpressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in\\nsolitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a\\ncabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.</p>\\n\\n<p>My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on,\\nfor I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing\\nfriends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my\\nprogress. I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that\\ncrowded into my mind. I passed through scenes familiar to my youth,\\nbut which I had not seen for nearly six years. How altered every\\nthing might be during that time! One sudden and desolating change\\nhad taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by\\ndegrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done\\nmore tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me;\\nI dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me\\ntremble, although I was unable to define them. I remained two days\\nat Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the\\nlake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy\\nmountains, \\'the palaces of nature,\\' were not changed. By degrees\\nthe calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey\\ntowards Geneva.</p>\\n\\n<p>The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I\\napproached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black\\nsides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a\\nchild. \"Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome\\nyour wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue\\nand placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my\\nunhappiness?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by\\ndwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of\\ncomparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My\\ncountry, my beloved country! who but a native can tell the delight\\nI took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more\\nthan all, thy lovely lake!</p>\\n\\n<p>Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me.\\nNight also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark\\nmountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast\\nand dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined\\nto become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied\\ntruly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the\\nmisery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth\\npart of the anguish I was destined to endure. It was completely\\ndark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the\\ntown were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at\\nSecheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city.\\nThe sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to\\nvisit the spot where my poor William had been murdered. As I could\\nnot pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a\\nboat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the\\nlightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful\\nfigures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I\\nascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It\\nadvanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming\\nslowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.</p>\\n\\n<p>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and\\nstorm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific\\ncrash over my head. It was echoed from Saleve, the Juras, and the\\nAlps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes,\\nilluminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire;\\nthen for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until\\nthe eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is\\noften the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of\\nthe heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town,\\nover the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of\\nBelrive and the village of Copet. Another storm enlightened Jura\\nwith faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed\\nthe Mole, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.</p>\\n\\n<p>While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I\\nwandered on with a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated\\nmy spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, \"William, dear\\nangel! this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!\" As I said these words,\\nI perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump\\nof trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be\\nmistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and\\ndiscovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the\\ndeformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity,\\ninstantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy daemon, to\\nwhom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered\\nat the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that\\nidea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my\\nteeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for\\nsupport. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the\\ngloom.</p>\\n\\n<p>Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child.\\n<i>He</i> was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence\\nof the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of\\npursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another\\nflash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\\nperpendicular ascent of Mont Saleve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais\\non the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.</p>\\n\\n<p>I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still\\ncontinued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.\\nI revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to\\nforget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the\\nappearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its\\ndeparture. Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on\\nwhich he first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I\\nhad turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight\\nwas in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?</p>\\n\\n<p>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder\\nof the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I\\ndid not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was\\nbusy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I\\nhad cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to\\neffect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done,\\nnearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from\\nthe grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.</p>\\n\\n<p>Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates\\nwere open, and I hastened to my father\\'s house. My first thought\\nwas to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant\\npursuit to be made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that\\nI had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with\\nlife, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an\\ninaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with\\nwhich I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation,\\nand which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so\\nutterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated\\nsuch a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings\\nof insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude\\nall pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my\\nrelatives to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit?\\nWho could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging\\nsides of Mont Saleve? These reflections determined me, and I\\nresolved to remain silent.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father\\'s\\nhouse. I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into\\nthe library to attend their usual hour of rising.</p>\\n\\n<p>Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible\\ntrace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my\\nfather before my departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable\\nparent! He still remained to me. I gazed on the picture of my\\nmother, which stood over the mantel-piece. It was an historical\\nsubject, painted at my father\\'s desire, and represented Caroline\\nBeaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead\\nfather. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an\\nair of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of\\npity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears\\nflowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest\\nentered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\\n\"Welcome, my dearest Victor,\" said he. \"Ah! I wish you had come\\nthree months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\\ndelighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\\nalleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who\\nseems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will\\ninduce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting\\nself-accusations.&mdash;Poor William! he was our darling and our\\npride!\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother\\'s eyes; a sense of\\nmortal agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the\\nwretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new,\\nand a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I\\nenquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I named my\\ncousin.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"She most of all,\" said Ernest, \"requires consolation; she\\naccused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that\\nmade her very wretched. But since the murderer has been\\ndiscovered&mdash;\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could\\nattempt to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to\\novertake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I\\nsaw him too; he was free last night!\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I do not know what you mean,\" replied my brother, in accents of\\nwonder, \"but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.\\nNo one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not\\nbe convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would\\ncredit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the\\nfamily, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so\\nappalling a crime?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is\\nwrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely,\\nErnest?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that\\nhave almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has\\nbeen so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that,\\nI fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and\\nyou will then hear all.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor\\nWilliam had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and\\nconfined to her bed for several days. During this interval, one of\\nthe servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the\\nnight of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my\\nmother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.\\nThe servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without\\nsaying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon\\ntheir deposition, Justine was apprehended. On being charged with\\nthe fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure\\nby her extreme confusion of manner.</p>\\n\\n<p>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I\\nreplied earnestly, \"You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.\\nJustine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply\\nimpressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me\\ncheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting,\\nwould have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster,\\nhad not Ernest exclaimed, \"Good God, papa! Victor says that he\\nknows who was the murderer of poor William.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We do also, unfortunately,\" replied my father, \"for indeed I\\nhad rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much\\ndepravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is\\nto be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be\\nacquitted.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind\\nthat Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this\\nmurder. I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence\\ncould be brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was\\nnot one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked\\nupon as madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I,\\nthe creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in\\nthe existence of the living monument of presumption and rash\\nignorance which I had let loose upon the world?</p>\\n\\n<p>We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I\\nlast beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the\\nbeauty of her childish years. There was the same candour, the same\\nvivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of\\nsensibility and intellect. She welcomed me with the greatest\\naffection. \"Your arrival, my dear cousin,\" said she, \"fills me with\\nhope. You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless\\nJustine. Alas! who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on\\nher innocence as certainly as I do upon my own. Our misfortune is\\ndoubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy,\\nbut this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by\\neven a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy\\nmore. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be\\nhappy again, even after the sad death of my little William.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"She is innocent, my Elizabeth,\" said I, \"and that shall be\\nproved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the\\nassurance of her acquittal.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her\\nguilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was\\nimpossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a\\nmanner rendered me hopeless and despairing.\" She wept.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Dearest niece,\" said my father, \"dry your tears. If she is, as\\nyou believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the\\nactivity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of\\npartiality.\"</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 8</h2>\\n\\n<p>We passed a few sad hours until eleven o\\'clock, when the trial\\nwas to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged\\nto attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the\\nwhole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living\\ntorture. It was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity\\nand lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow\\nbeings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far\\nmore dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that\\ncould make the murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl\\nof merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life\\nhappy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I\\nthe cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself\\nguilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it\\nwas committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as\\nthe ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who\\nsuffered through me.</p>\\n\\n<p>The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning,\\nand her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the\\nsolemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared\\nconfident in innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and\\nexecrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might\\notherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the\\nspectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to\\nhave committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was\\nevidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced\\nas a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of\\ncourage. When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and\\nquickly discovered where we were seated. A tear seemed to dim her\\neye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look\\nof sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter\\nguiltlessness.</p>\\n\\n<p>The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated\\nthe charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts\\ncombined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not\\nsuch proof of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of\\nthe night on which the murder had been committed and towards\\nmorning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot\\nwhere the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The\\nwoman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely\\nand only returned a confused and unintelligible answer. She\\nreturned to the house about eight o\\'clock, and when one inquired\\nwhere she had passed the night, she replied that she had been\\nlooking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been\\nheard concerning him. When shown the body, she fell into violent\\nhysterics and kept her bed for several days. The picture was then\\nproduced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when\\nElizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which,\\nan hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his\\nneck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.</p>\\n\\n<p>Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had\\nproceeded, her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and\\nmisery were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her\\ntears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers\\nand spoke in an audible although variable voice.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"God knows,\" she said, \"how entirely I am innocent. But I do not\\npretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence\\non a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been\\nadduced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne\\nwill incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any\\ncircumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had\\npassed the evening of the night on which the murder had been\\ncommitted at the house of an aunt at Chene, a village situated at\\nabout a league from Geneva. On her return, at about nine o\\'clock,\\nshe met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child\\nwho was lost. She was alarmed by this account and passed several\\nhours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and\\nshe was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn\\nbelonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants,\\nto whom she was well known. Most of the night she spent here\\nwatching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few\\nminutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn, and\\nshe quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my\\nbrother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was\\nwithout her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when questioned\\nby the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a\\nsleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.\\nConcerning the picture she could give no account.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I know,\" continued the unhappy victim, \"how heavily and fatally\\nthis one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of\\nexplaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am\\nonly left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it\\nmight have been placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I\\nbelieve that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have\\nbeen so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did the murderer place it\\nthere? I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I\\nhad, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so\\nsoon?</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no\\nroom for hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined\\nconcerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh\\nmy supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my\\nsalvation on my innocence.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years,\\nand they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of\\nwhich they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling\\nto come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her\\nexcellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail\\nthe accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired\\npermission to address the court.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I am,\" said she, \"the cousin of the unhappy child who was\\nmurdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have\\nlived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth.\\nIt may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this\\noccasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through\\nthe cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to\\nspeak, that I may say what I know of her character. I am well\\nacquainted with the accused. I have lived in the same house with\\nher, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years.\\nDuring all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and\\nbenevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my\\naunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and\\nafterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a\\nmanner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which\\nshe again lived in my uncle\\'s house, where she was beloved by all\\nthe family. She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead\\nand acted towards him like a most affectionate mother. For my own\\npart, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the\\nevidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect\\ninnocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to the\\nbauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired\\nit, I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem\\nand value her.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth\\'s simple and powerful\\nappeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in\\nfavour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned\\nwith renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.\\nShe herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own\\nagitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I\\nbelieved in her innocence; I knew it. Could the demon who had (I\\ndid not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish\\nsport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not\\nsustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the\\npopular voice and the countenances of the judges had already\\ncondemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony.\\nThe tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained\\nby innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not\\nforgo their hold.</p>\\n\\n<p>I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I\\nwent to the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask\\nthe fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the\\ncause of my visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all\\nblack, and Justine was condemned.</p>\\n\\n<p>I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before\\nexperienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow\\nupon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of\\nthe heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom\\nI addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her\\nguilt. \"That evidence,\" he observed, \"was hardly required in so\\nglaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our\\njudges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be\\nit ever so decisive.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it\\nmean? Had my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole\\nworld would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my\\nsuspicions? I hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly\\ndemanded the result.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"My cousin,\" replied I, \"it is decided as you may have expected;\\nall judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one\\nguilty should escape. But she has confessed.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with\\nfirmness upon Justine\\'s innocence. \"Alas!\" said she. \"How shall I\\never again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and\\nesteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of\\ninnocence only to betray? Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any\\nseverity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire\\nto see my cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he\\nleft it to her own judgment and feelings to decide. \"Yes,\" said\\nElizabeth, \"I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor,\\nshall accompany me; I cannot go alone.\" The idea of this visit was\\ntorture to me, yet I could not refuse. We entered the gloomy prison\\nchamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the farther\\nend; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees. She\\nrose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with her, she\\nthrew herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin\\nwept also.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Oh, Justine!\" said she. \"Why did you rob me of my last\\nconsolation? I relied on your innocence, and although I was then\\nvery wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you\\nalso join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a\\nmurderer?\" Her voice was suffocated with sobs.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Rise, my poor girl,\" said Elizabeth; \"why do you kneel, if you\\nare innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you\\nguiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you\\nhad yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false;\\nand be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence\\nin you for a moment, but your own confession.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might\\nobtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart\\nthan all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I\\nwas condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and\\nmenaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that\\nhe said I was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my\\nlast moments if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to\\nsupport me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and\\nperdition. What could I do? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie;\\nand now only am I truly miserable.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>She paused, weeping, and then continued, \"I thought with horror,\\nmy sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your\\nblessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a\\ncreature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could\\nhave perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall\\nsee you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that\\nconsoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted\\nyou. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear.\\nI will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony\\nhearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!\\nYou, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the\\nscaffold! No! No! I never could survive so horrible a\\nmisfortune.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Justine shook her head mournfully. \"I do not fear to die,\" she\\nsaid; \"that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me\\ncourage to endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if\\nyou remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am\\nresigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to\\nsubmit in patience to the will of heaven!\"</p>\\n\\n<p>During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison\\nroom, where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.\\nDespair! Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow\\nwas to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as\\nI did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground\\nthem together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.\\nJustine started. When she saw who it was, she approached me and\\nsaid, \"Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not\\nbelieve that I am guilty?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I could not answer. \"No, Justine,\" said Elizabeth; \"he is more\\nconvinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that\\nyou had confessed, he did not credit it.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest\\ngratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is\\nthe affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more\\nthan half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now\\nthat my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your\\ncousin.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She\\nindeed gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true\\nmurderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which\\nallowed of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was\\nunhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a\\ncloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot\\ntarnish its brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the\\ncore of my heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could\\nextinguish. We stayed several hours with Justine, and it was with\\ngreat difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away. \"I wish,\"\\ncried she, \"that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this\\nworld of misery.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with\\ndifficulty repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and\\nsaid in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, \"Farewell, sweet lady,\\ndearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its\\nbounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune\\nthat you will ever suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others\\nso.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth\\'s heart-rending\\neloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction\\nin the criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and\\nindignant appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their\\ncold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men,\\nmy purposed avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim\\nmyself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my\\nwretched victim. She perished on the scaffold as a murderess!</p>\\n\\n<p>From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the\\ndeep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing!\\nAnd my father\\'s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling\\nhome all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy\\nones, but these are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the\\nfuneral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and\\nagain be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early,\\nmuch-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for\\nyour sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is\\nmirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air\\nwith blessings and spend his life in serving you&mdash;he bids you\\nweep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus\\ninexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before\\nthe peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!</p>\\n\\n<p>Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and\\ndespair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves\\nof William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed\\narts.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 9</h2>\\n\\n<p>Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the\\nfeelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the\\ndead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives\\nthe soul both of hope and fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was\\nalive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair\\nand remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove. Sleep\\nfled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had\\ncommitted deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more,\\nmuch more (I persuaded myself) was yet behind. Yet my heart\\noverflowed with kindness and the love of virtue. I had begun life\\nwith benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when I\\nshould put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow\\nbeings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience\\nwhich allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction,\\nand from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by\\nremorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of\\nintense tortures such as no language can describe.</p>\\n\\n<p>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps\\nnever entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I\\nshunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was\\ntorture to me; solitude was my only consolation&mdash;deep, dark,\\ndeathlike solitude.</p>\\n\\n<p>My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my\\ndisposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from\\nthe feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire\\nme with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark\\ncloud which brooded over me. \"Do you think, Victor,\" said he, \"that\\nI do not suffer also? No one could love a child more than I loved\\nyour brother\"&mdash;tears came into his eyes as he spoke&mdash;\"but\\nis it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from\\naugmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief?\\nIt is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents\\nimprovement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily\\nusefulness, without which no man is fit for society.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case;\\nI should have been the first to hide my grief and console my\\nfriends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its\\nalarm, with my other sensations. Now I could only answer my father\\nwith a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his\\nview.</p>\\n\\n<p>About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change\\nwas particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates\\nregularly at ten o\\'clock and the impossibility of remaining on the\\nlake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of\\nGeneva very irksome to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of\\nthe family had retired for the night, I took the boat and passed\\nmany hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was\\ncarried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of\\nthe lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to\\nmy own miserable reflections. I was often tempted, when all was at\\npeace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered\\nrestless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly&mdash;if I except\\nsome bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was\\nheard only when I approached the shore&mdash;often, I say, I was\\ntempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close\\nover me and my calamities forever. But I was restrained, when I\\nthought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly\\nloved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of\\nmy father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion\\nleave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom\\nI had let loose among them?</p>\\n\\n<p>At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would\\nrevisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and\\nhappiness. But that could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope.\\nI had been the author of unalterable evils, and I lived in daily\\nfear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new\\nwickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that\\nhe would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity\\nshould almost efface the recollection of the past. There was always\\nscope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind. My\\nabhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him\\nI gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished\\nto extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When\\nI reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst\\nall bounds of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the\\nhighest peak of the Andes, could I when there have precipitated him\\nto their base. I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the\\nutmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of\\nWilliam and Justine. Our house was the house of mourning. My\\nfather\\'s health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent\\nevents. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took\\ndelight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her\\nsacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought\\nwas the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and\\ndestroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier\\nyouth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with\\necstasy of our future prospects. The first of those sorrows which\\nare sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its dimming\\ninfluence quenched her dearest smiles.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"When I reflect, my dear cousin,\" said she, \"on the miserable\\ndeath of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as\\nthey before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of\\nvice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as\\ntales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote\\nand more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery\\nhas come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each\\nother\\'s blood. Yet I am certainly unjust. Everybody believed that\\npoor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime\\nfor which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most\\ndepraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have\\nmurdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had\\nnursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her\\nown! I could not consent to the death of any human being, but\\ncertainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in\\nthe society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel she was\\ninnocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas!\\nVictor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure\\nthemselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on the\\nedge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and\\nendeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were\\nassassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world\\nfree, and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer\\non the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with\\nsuch a wretch.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in\\ndeed, but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my\\nanguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, \"My\\ndearest friend, you must calm yourself. These events have affected\\nme, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.\\nThere is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in\\nyour countenance that makes me tremble. Dear Victor, banish these\\ndark passions. Remember the friends around you, who centre all\\ntheir hopes in you. Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?\\nAh! While we love, while we are true to each other, here in this\\nland of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap every\\ntranquil blessing&mdash;what can disturb our peace?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before\\nevery other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that\\nlurked in my heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in\\nterror, lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob\\nme of her.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth,\\nnor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of\\nlove were ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no\\nbeneficial influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its\\nfainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the\\narrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.</p>\\n\\n<p>Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed\\nme, but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to\\nseek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from\\nmy intolerable sensations. It was during an access of this kind\\nthat I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near\\nAlpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such\\nscenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows.\\nMy wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. I had\\nvisited it frequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since\\nthen: <i>I</i> was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage\\nand enduring scenes.</p>\\n\\n<p>I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I\\nafterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable\\nto receive injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it\\nwas about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months\\nafter the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated\\nall my woe. The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I\\nplunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and\\nprecipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river\\nraging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around\\nspoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence&mdash;and I ceased to fear\\nor to bend before any being less almighty than that which had\\ncreated and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most\\nterrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a\\nmore magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging\\non the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and\\ncottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees\\nformed a scene of singular beauty. But it was augmented and\\nrendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining\\npyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another\\nearth, the habitations of another race of beings.</p>\\n\\n<p>I passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the\\nriver forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain\\nthat overhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.\\nThis valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and\\npicturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The\\nhigh and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw\\nno more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers\\napproached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling\\navalanche and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the\\nsupreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the\\nsurrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous dome overlooked the\\nvalley.</p>\\n\\n<p>A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me\\nduring this journey. Some turn in the road, some new object\\nsuddenly perceived and recognized, reminded me of days gone by, and\\nwere associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very\\nwinds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal Nature bade me\\nweep no more. Then again the kindly influence ceased to act&mdash;I\\nfound myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the\\nmisery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to\\nforget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself&mdash;or, in\\na more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass,\\nweighed down by horror and despair.</p>\\n\\n<p>At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion\\nsucceeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I\\nhad endured. For a short space of time I remained at the window\\nwatching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and\\nlistening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way\\nbeneath. The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen\\nsensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over\\nme; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 10</h2>\\n\\n<p>I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood\\nbeside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a\\nglacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of\\nthe hills to barricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast\\nmountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me;\\na few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence\\nof this glorious presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken\\nonly by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the\\nthunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along\\nthe mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent\\nworking of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if\\nit had been but a plaything in their hands. These sublime and\\nmagnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was\\ncapable of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of\\nfeeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued\\nand tranquillized it. In some degree, also, they diverted my mind\\nfrom the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. I\\nretired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and\\nministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had\\ncontemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the\\nunstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine\\nwoods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the\\nclouds&mdash;they all gathered round me and bade me be at\\npeace.</p>\\n\\n<p>Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of\\nsoul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every\\nthought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the\\nsummits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those\\nmighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek\\nthem in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My\\nmule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the\\nsummit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the\\ntremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I\\nfirst saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that\\ngave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure\\nworld to light and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in\\nnature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind and\\ncausing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined to go\\nwithout a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the\\npresence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the\\nscene.</p>\\n\\n<p>The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual\\nand short windings, which enable you to surmount the\\nperpendicularity of the mountain. It is a scene terrifically\\ndesolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche\\nmay be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground,\\nsome entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting\\nrocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees. The path,\\nas you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which\\nstones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly\\ndangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud\\nvoice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction\\nupon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or luxuriant,\\nbut they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene. I\\nlooked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the\\nrivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the\\nopposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds,\\nwhile rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy\\nimpression I received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does\\nman boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute;\\nit only renders them more necessary beings. If our impulses were\\nconfined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free;\\nbut now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or\\nscene that that word may convey to us.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.<br>\\nWe rise; one wand\\'ring thought pollutes the day.<br>\\nWe feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,<br>\\nEmbrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;<br>\\nIt is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,<br>\\nThe path of its departure still is free.<br>\\nMan\\'s yesterday may ne\\'er be like his morrow;<br>\\nNought may endure but mutability!</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For\\nsome time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist\\ncovered both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze\\ndissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface\\nis very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending\\nlow, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is\\nalmost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing\\nit. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the\\nside where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the\\ndistance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful\\nmajesty. I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this\\nwonderful and stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the vast river\\nof ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits\\nhung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the\\nsunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now\\nswelled with something like joy; I exclaimed, \"Wandering spirits,\\nif indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me\\nthis faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the\\njoys of life.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some\\ndistance, advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded\\nover the crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with\\ncaution; his stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that\\nof man. I was troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a\\nfaintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of\\nthe mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight\\ntremendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had\\ncreated. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his\\napproach and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached;\\nhis countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and\\nmalignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too\\nhorrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this; rage and\\nhatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only\\nto overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and\\ncontempt.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Devil,\" I exclaimed, \"do you dare approach me? And do not you\\nfear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?\\nBegone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to\\ndust! And, oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable\\nexistence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically\\nmurdered!\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I expected this reception,\" said the daemon. \"All men hate the\\nwretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all\\nliving things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy\\ncreature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the\\nannihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you\\nsport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine\\ntowards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my\\nconditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse,\\nI will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood\\nof your remaining friends.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are\\ntoo mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach\\nme with your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the\\nspark which I so negligently bestowed.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the\\nfeelings which can arm one being against the existence of\\nanother.</p>\\n\\n<p>He easily eluded me and said,</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your\\nhatred on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you\\nseek to increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an\\naccumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.\\nRemember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height\\nis superior to thine, my joints more supple. But I will not be\\ntempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and\\nI will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou\\nwilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh,\\nFrankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me\\nalone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is\\nmost due. Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam,\\nbut I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no\\nmisdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably\\nexcluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make\\nme happy, and I shall again be virtuous.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between\\nyou and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a\\nfight, in which one must fall.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a\\nfavourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and\\ncompassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul\\nglowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone?\\nYou, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow\\ncreatures, who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert\\nmountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here\\nmany days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a\\ndwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge. These\\nbleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow\\nbeings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they\\nwould do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction. Shall I\\nnot then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my\\nenemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness. Yet\\nit is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil\\nwhich it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you\\nand your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in\\nthe whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be moved, and do\\nnot disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard that,\\nabandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve. But\\nhear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are,\\nto speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen to\\nme, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with\\na satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the\\neternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to\\nme, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your\\nhands.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Why do you call to my remembrance,\" I rejoined, \"circumstances\\nof which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable\\norigin and author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you\\nfirst saw light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that\\nformed you! You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have\\nleft me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not.\\nBegone! Relieve me from the sight of your detested form.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Thus I relieve thee, my creator,\" he said, and placed his hated\\nhands before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; \"thus I\\ntake from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to\\nme and grant me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once\\npossessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and\\nstrange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your\\nfine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet\\nhigh in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your\\nsnowy precipices and illuminate another world, you will have heard\\nmy story and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit forever\\nthe neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the\\nscourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy\\nruin.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My\\nheart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I\\nweighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at\\nleast to listen to his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and\\ncompassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to\\nbe the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation\\nor denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I felt what\\nthe duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought\\nto render him happy before I complained of his wickedness. These\\nmotives urged me to comply with his demand. We crossed the ice,\\ntherefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The air was cold, and\\nthe rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with\\nan air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits.\\nBut I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire which my\\nodious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 11</h2>\\n\\n<p>\"It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original\\nera of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and\\nindistinct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I\\nsaw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a\\nlong time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of\\nmy various senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed\\nupon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness\\nthen came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when,\\nby opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me\\nagain. I walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found a\\ngreat alteration in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies\\nhad surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found\\nthat I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could\\nnot either surmount or avoid. The light became more and more\\noppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a\\nplace where I could receive shade. This was the forest near\\nIngolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my\\nfatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused\\nme from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I\\nfound hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my\\nthirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by\\nsleep.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half\\nfrightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.\\nBefore I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had\\ncovered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to\\nsecure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable\\nwretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain\\ninvade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a\\nsensation of pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise\\nfrom among the trees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It\\nmoved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in\\nsearch of berries. I was still cold when under one of the trees I\\nfound a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon\\nthe ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I\\nfelt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable\\nsounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me;\\nthe only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I\\nfixed my eyes on that with pleasure.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night\\nhad greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations\\nfrom each other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that\\nsupplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their\\nfoliage. I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant\\nsound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of\\nthe little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from\\nmy eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms\\nthat surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant\\nroof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the\\npleasant songs of the birds but was unable. Sometimes I wished to\\nexpress my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and\\ninarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence\\nagain.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a\\nlessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest.\\nMy sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind\\nreceived every day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to\\nthe light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I\\ndistinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb\\nfrom another. I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh\\nnotes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and\\nenticing.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had\\nbeen left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight\\nat the warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand\\ninto the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of\\npain. How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce\\nsuch opposite effects! I examined the materials of the fire, and to\\nmy joy found it to be composed of wood. I quickly collected some\\nbranches, but they were wet and would not burn. I was pained at\\nthis and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wood\\nwhich I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed.\\nI reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I\\ndiscovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great\\nquantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply\\nof fire. When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the\\ngreatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it\\ncarefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it;\\nand then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into\\nsleep.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the\\nfire. I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a\\nflame. I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which\\nroused the embers when they were nearly extinguished. When night\\ncame again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well\\nas heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in\\nmy food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had\\nleft had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the\\nberries I gathered from the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress my\\nfood in the same manner, placing it on the live embers. I found\\nthat the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and\\nroots much improved.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day\\nsearching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.\\nWhen I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto\\ninhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would\\nbe more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented\\nthe loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew\\nnot how to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious\\nconsideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish\\nall attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I\\nstruck across the wood towards the setting sun. I passed three days\\nin these rambles and at length discovered the open country. A great\\nfall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were\\nof one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found\\nmy feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the\\nground.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food\\nand shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground,\\nwhich had doubtless been built for the convenience of some\\nshepherd. This was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure\\nwith great curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man\\nsat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.\\nHe turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly,\\nand quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which\\nhis debilitated form hardly appeared capable. His appearance,\\ndifferent from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat\\nsurprised me. But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut;\\nhere the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and\\nit presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as\\nPandemonium appeared to the demons of hell after their sufferings\\nin the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the\\nshepherd\\'s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and\\nwine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by\\nfatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun,\\nwhich shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to\\nrecommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant\\'s\\nbreakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for\\nseveral hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village. How\\nmiraculous did this appear! The huts, the neater cottages, and\\nstately houses engaged my admiration by turns. The vegetables in\\nthe gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows\\nof some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of\\nthese I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door\\nbefore the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted. The\\nwhole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\\ngrievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile\\nweapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in\\na low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the\\npalaces I had beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a\\ncottage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly\\nbought experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge was\\nconstructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit\\nupright in it. No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which\\nformed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it\\nby innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow\\nand rain.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a\\nshelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and\\nstill more from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I\\ncrept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and\\ndiscover if I could remain in the habitation I had found. It was\\nsituated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the\\nsides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water.\\nOne part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered\\nevery crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood,\\nyet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass\\nout; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was\\nsufficient for me.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean\\nstraw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and\\nI remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself\\nin his power. I had first, however, provided for my sustenance for\\nthat day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup\\nwith which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the\\npure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was a little\\nraised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to\\nthe chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until\\nsomething should occur which might alter my determination. It was\\nindeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former\\nresidence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my\\nbreakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure\\nmyself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a\\nsmall chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head,\\npassing before my hovel. The girl was young and of gentle\\ndemeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse\\nservants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat\\nand a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited\\nbut not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost sight of her,\\nand in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail,\\nwhich was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,\\nseemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\\ncountenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds\\nwith an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore\\nit to the cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared.\\nPresently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand,\\ncross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied,\\nsometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of\\nthe cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had\\nbeen filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost\\nimperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.\\nThrough this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and\\nclean but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire,\\nsat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate\\nattitude. The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but\\npresently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her\\nhands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an\\ninstrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the\\nvoice of the thrush or the nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even\\nto me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before. The\\nsilver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my\\nreverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He\\nplayed a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the\\neyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice,\\nuntil she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the\\nfair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised her\\nand smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations\\nof a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain\\nand pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from\\nhunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window,\\nunable to bear these emotions.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his\\nshoulders a load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to\\nrelieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the\\ncottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart\\ninto a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a\\npiece of cheese. She seemed pleased and went into the garden for\\nsome roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the\\nfire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went\\ninto the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling\\nup roots. After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young\\nwoman joined him and they entered the cottage together.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the\\nappearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and\\nthey sat down to eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young\\nwoman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man\\nwalked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on\\nthe arm of the youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast\\nbetween these two excellent creatures. One was old, with silver\\nhairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the\\nyounger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features\\nwere moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude\\nexpressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The old man returned\\nto the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he\\nhad used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that\\nthe cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers,\\nand was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put\\nan end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human\\nneighbours. In the evening the young girl and her companion were\\nemployed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the\\nold man again took up the instrument which produced the divine\\nsounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had\\nfinished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that\\nwere monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old\\nman\\'s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found that he\\nread aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words\\nor letters.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,\\nextinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to\\nrest.\"</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 12</h2>\\n\\n<p>\"I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the\\noccurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle\\nmanners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not.\\nI remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before\\nfrom the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of\\nconduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the\\npresent I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and\\nendeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their\\nactions.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young\\nwoman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth\\ndeparted after the first meal.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded\\nit. The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the\\ngirl in various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I\\nsoon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his\\ninstrument or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and\\nrespect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their\\nvenerable companion. They performed towards him every little office\\nof affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his\\nbenevolent smiles.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion\\noften went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their\\nunhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely\\ncreatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect\\nand solitary being, should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle\\nbeings unhappy? They possessed a delightful house (for such it was\\nin my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when\\nchill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in\\nexcellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another\\'s\\ncompany and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and\\nkindness. What did their tears imply? Did they really express pain?\\nI was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual\\nattention and time explained to me many appearances which were at\\nfirst enigmatic.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the\\ncauses of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty,\\nand they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their\\nnourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden\\nand the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter,\\nwhen its masters could scarcely procure food to support it. They\\noften, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly,\\nespecially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed\\nfood before the old man when they reserved none for themselves.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been\\naccustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my\\nown consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted\\npain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with\\nberries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring\\nwood.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to\\nassist their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of\\neach day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the\\nnight I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly\\ndiscovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption\\nof several days.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman,\\nwhen she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly\\nastonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside. She\\nuttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who\\nalso expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did not\\ngo to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage\\nand cultivating the garden.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found\\nthat these people possessed a method of communicating their\\nexperience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I\\nperceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or\\npain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the\\nhearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired\\nto become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every attempt I\\nmade for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and the words\\nthey uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible\\nobjects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel\\nthe mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and\\nafter having remained during the space of several revolutions of\\nthe moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to\\nsome of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and\\napplied the words, \\'fire,\\' \\'milk,\\' \\'bread,\\' and \\'wood.\\' I learned\\nalso the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his\\ncompanion had each of them several names, but the old man had only\\none, which was \\'father.\\' The girl was called \\'sister\\' or \\'Agatha,\\'\\nand the youth \\'Felix,\\' \\'brother,\\' or \\'son.\\' I cannot describe the\\ndelight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of\\nthese sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished\\nseveral other words without being able as yet to understand or\\napply them, such as \\'good,\\' \\'dearest,\\' \\'unhappy.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and\\nbeauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were\\nunhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in\\ntheir joys. I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other\\nhappened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait\\nonly enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. The\\nold man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his\\nchildren, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off\\ntheir melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an\\nexpression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha\\nlistened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which\\nshe endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found\\nthat her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having\\nlistened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with\\nFelix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my\\nunpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than\\nhis friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice\\nwas more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he\\naddressed the old man.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight,\\nmarked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of\\npoverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the\\nfirst little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy\\nground. Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away\\nthe snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water\\nfrom the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to\\nhis perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished\\nby an invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes\\nfor a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not\\nreturn until dinner, yet brought no wood with him. At other times\\nhe worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the\\nfrosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees\\nI discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read\\nas when he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the\\npaper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed\\nto comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not\\neven understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I\\nimproved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently\\nto follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole\\nmind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I\\neagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to\\nmake the attempt until I had first become master of their language,\\nwhich knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity\\nof my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented\\nto my eyes had made me acquainted.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers&mdash;their\\ngrace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified\\nwhen I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At first I started\\nback, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in\\nthe mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality\\nthe monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations\\nof despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know\\nthe fatal effects of this miserable deformity.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow\\nvanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From\\nthis time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications\\nof impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found,\\nwas coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency\\nof it. Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which\\nthey dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the\\nseason advanced.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when\\nit did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured\\nforth its waters. This frequently took place, but a high wind\\nquickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant\\nthan it had been.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I\\nattended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed\\nin various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent\\nin observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there\\nwas any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and\\ncollected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as\\noften as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and\\nperformed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards\\nfound that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly\\nastonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these\\noccasions, utter the words \\'good spirit,\\' \\'wonderful\\'; but I did\\nnot then understand the signification of these terms.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover\\nthe motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was\\ninquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so\\nsad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to\\nrestore happiness to these deserving people. When I slept or was\\nabsent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha,\\nand the excellent Felix flitted before me. I looked upon them as\\nsuperior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I\\nformed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself\\nto them, and their reception of me. I imagined that they would be\\ndisgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I\\nshould first win their favour and afterwards their love.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh\\nardour to the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed\\nharsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft\\nmusic of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood\\nwith tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely\\nthe gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his\\nmanners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and\\nexecration.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly\\naltered the aspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed\\nto have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in\\nvarious arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes,\\nand the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth!\\nFit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak,\\ndamp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting\\nappearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the\\npresent was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope\\nand anticipations of joy.\"</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 13</h2>\\n\\n<p>\"I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall\\nrelate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I\\nhad been, have made me what I am.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies\\ncloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy\\nshould now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My\\nsenses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight\\nand a thousand sights of beauty.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically\\nrested from labour&mdash;the old man played on his guitar, and the\\nchildren listened to him&mdash;that I observed the countenance of\\nFelix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and\\nonce his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his\\nmanner that he inquired the cause of his son\\'s sorrow. Felix\\nreplied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his\\nmusic when someone tapped at the door.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a\\nguide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick\\nblack veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only\\nreplied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her\\nvoice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On\\nhearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she\\nsaw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic\\nbeauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and\\ncuriously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although\\nanimated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion\\nwondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait\\nof sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a\\ndegree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it\\ncapable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and\\nat that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She\\nappeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from\\nher lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it\\nrapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his\\nsweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand him, but smiled. He\\nassisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her\\ninto the cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his\\nfather, and the young stranger knelt at the old man\\'s feet and\\nwould have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her\\naffectionately.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate\\nsounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither\\nunderstood by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many\\nsigns which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence\\ndiffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as\\nthe sun dissipates the morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy\\nand with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the\\never-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and\\npointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean\\nthat he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus,\\nwhile they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of\\nwhich I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent\\nrecurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them,\\nthat she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea\\ninstantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same\\ninstructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty\\nwords at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I\\nhad before understood, but I profited by the others.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When\\nthey separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said,\\n\\'Good night sweet Safie.\\' He sat up much longer, conversing with\\nhis father, and by the frequent repetition of her name I\\nconjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their\\nconversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every\\nfaculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the\\nusual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the\\nfeet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so\\nentrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and\\ndelight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich\\ncadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the\\nwoods.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at\\nfirst declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice\\naccompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of\\nthe stranger. The old man appeared enraptured and said some words\\nwhich Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he\\nappeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest\\ndelight by her music.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole\\nalteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances\\nof my friends. Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved\\nrapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began\\nto comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with\\nherbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers,\\nsweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the\\nmoonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy;\\nand my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although\\nthey were considerably shortened by the late setting and early\\nrising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight,\\nfearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured\\nin the first village which I entered.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"My days were spent in close attention, that I might more\\nspeedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more\\nrapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed\\nin broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost\\nevery word that was spoken.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of\\nletters as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me\\na wide field for wonder and delight.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney\\'s Ruins\\nof Empires. I should not have understood the purport of this book\\nhad not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He\\nhad chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was\\nframed in imitation of the Eastern authors. Through this work I\\nobtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several\\nempires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight\\ninto the manners, governments, and religions of the different\\nnations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the\\nstupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars\\nand wonderful virtue of the early Romans&mdash;of their subsequent\\ndegenerating&mdash;of the decline of that mighty empire, of\\nchivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the\\nAmerican hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of\\nits original inhabitants.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.\\nWas man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent,\\nyet so vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of\\nthe evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of\\nnoble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the\\nhighest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and\\nvicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest\\ndegradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or\\nharmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man\\ncould go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws\\nand governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my\\nwonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to\\nme. While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon\\nthe Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to\\nme. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and\\nsqualid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the\\npossessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and\\nunsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with\\nonly one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,\\nexcept in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to\\nwaste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I?\\nOf my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew\\nthat I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was,\\nbesides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I\\nwas not even of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they\\nand could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat\\nand cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded\\ntheirs. When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me. Was\\nI, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled\\nand whom all men disowned?</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections\\ninflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only\\nincreased with knowledge. Oh, that I had forever remained in my\\nnative wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger,\\nthirst, and heat!</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind\\nwhen it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished\\nsometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that\\nthere was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that\\nwas death&mdash;a state which I feared yet did not understand. I\\nadmired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and\\namiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from\\nintercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by\\nstealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased\\nthan satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows.\\nThe gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming\\nArabian were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man and\\nthe lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me.\\nMiserable, unhappy wretch!</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard\\nof the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children,\\nhow the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively\\nsallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the\\nmother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of\\nyouth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all\\nthe various relationships which bind one human being to another in\\nmutual bonds.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched\\nmy infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses;\\nor if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in\\nwhich I distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had\\nbeen as I then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a\\nbeing resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What\\nwas I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with\\ngroans.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me\\nnow to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such\\nvarious feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all\\nterminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for\\nso I loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call\\nthem).\"</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 14</h2>\\n\\n<p>\"Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends.\\nIt was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my\\nmind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each\\ninteresting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I\\nwas.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a\\ngood family in France, where he had lived for many years in\\naffluence, respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals.\\nHis son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had\\nranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months before\\nmy arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called\\nParis, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which\\nvirtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a\\nmoderate fortune, could afford.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a\\nTurkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for\\nsome reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the\\ngovernment. He was seized and cast into prison the very day that\\nSafie arrived from Constantinople to join him. He was tried and\\ncondemned to death. The injustice of his sentence was very\\nflagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his\\nreligion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had\\nbeen the cause of his condemnation.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror\\nand indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of\\nthe court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and\\nthen looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to\\ngain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in\\nan unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the\\nunfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair\\nthe execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at\\nnight and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.\\nThe Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of\\nhis deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his\\noffers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was\\nallowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her\\nlively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind\\nthat the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his\\ntoil and hazard.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had\\nmade on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more\\nentirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so\\nsoon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too\\ndelicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the\\nprobability of the event as to the consummation of his\\nhappiness.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going\\nforward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was\\nwarmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl,\\nwho found means to express her thoughts in the language of her\\nlover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who\\nunderstood French. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his\\nintended services towards her parent, and at the same time she\\ngently deplored her own fate.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my\\nresidence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and\\nthe letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I\\ndepart I will give them to you; they will prove the truth of my\\ntale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall\\nonly have time to repeat the substance of them to you.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and\\nmade a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won\\nthe heart of the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl\\nspoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in\\nfreedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced. She\\ninstructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught\\nher to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of\\nspirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad. This lady\\ndied, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of\\nSafie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and\\nbeing immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy\\nherself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of her\\nsoul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for\\nvirtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a\\ncountry where women were allowed to take a rank in society was\\nenchanting to her.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the\\nnight previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was\\ndistant many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in\\nthe name of his father, sister, and himself. He had previously\\ncommunicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by\\nquitting his house, under the pretence of a journey and concealed\\nhimself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and\\nacross Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to\\nwait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the\\nTurkish dominions.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of\\nhis departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that\\nshe should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them\\nin expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the\\nsociety of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and\\ntenderest affection. They conversed with one another through the\\nmeans of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of\\nlooks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native\\ncountry.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the\\nhopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far\\nother plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united\\nto a Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should\\nappear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his\\ndeliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state\\nwhich they inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he\\nshould be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer\\nnecessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he\\ndeparted. His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from\\nParis.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of\\ntheir victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his\\ndeliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey\\nand Agatha were thrown into prison. The news reached Felix and\\nroused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father\\nand his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the\\nfree air and the society of her whom he loved. This idea was\\ntorture to him. He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the\\nlatter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix\\ncould return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a\\nconvent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he\\nhastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the\\nlaw, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months\\nbefore the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of\\ntheir fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their\\nnative country.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where\\nI discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk,\\nfor whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on\\ndiscovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and\\nruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted\\nItaly with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of\\nmoney to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future\\nmaintenance.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and\\nrendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his\\nfamily. He could have endured poverty, and while this distress had\\nbeen the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude\\nof the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more\\nbitter and irreparable. The arrival of the Arabian now infused new\\nlife into his soul.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his\\nwealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no\\nmore of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country.\\nThe generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she\\nattempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily,\\nreiterating his tyrannical mandate.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter\\'s apartment and\\ntold her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence\\nat Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be\\ndelivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired a\\nvessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should\\nsail in a few hours. He intended to leave his daughter under the\\ncare of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the\\ngreater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at\\nLeghorn.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct\\nthat it would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence\\nin Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were\\nalike averse to it. By some papers of her father which fell into\\nher hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name\\nof the spot where he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at\\nlength she formed her determination. Taking with her some jewels\\nthat belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an\\nattendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common\\nlanguage of Turkey, and departed for Germany.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the\\ncottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie\\nnursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died,\\nand the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of\\nthe country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She\\nfell, however, into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name\\nof the spot for which they were bound, and after her death the\\nwoman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie\\nshould arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.\"</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 15</h2>\\n\\n<p>\"Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me\\ndeeply. I learned, from the views of social life which it\\ndeveloped, to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of\\nmankind.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and\\ngenerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire\\nto become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable\\nqualities were called forth and displayed. But in giving an account\\nof the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance\\nwhich occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same\\nyear.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood\\nwhere I collected my own food and brought home firing for my\\nprotectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing\\nseveral articles of dress and some books. I eagerly seized the\\nprize and returned with it to my hovel. Fortunately the books were\\nwritten in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at\\nthe cottage; they consisted of Paradise Lost, a volume of\\nPlutarch\\'s Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter. The possession of\\nthese treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied\\nand exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were\\nemployed in their ordinary occupations.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They\\nproduced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that\\nsometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into\\nthe lowest dejection. In the Sorrows of Werter, besides the\\ninterest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are\\ncanvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to\\nme obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of\\nspeculation and astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it\\ndescribed, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had\\nfor their object something out of self, accorded well with my\\nexperience among my protectors and with the wants which were\\nforever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more\\ndivine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character\\ncontained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon\\ndeath and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not\\npretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined\\ntowards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without\\nprecisely understanding it.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own\\nfeelings and condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time\\nstrangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose\\nconversation I was a listener. I sympathized with and partly\\nunderstood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on\\nnone and related to none. \\'The path of my departure was free,\\' and\\nthere was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous and\\nmy stature gigantic. What did this mean? Who was I? What was I?\\nWhence did I come? What was my destination? These questions\\ncontinually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The volume of Plutarch\\'s Lives which I possessed contained the\\nhistories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book\\nhad a far different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter. I\\nlearned from Werter\\'s imaginations despondency and gloom, but\\nPlutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched\\nsphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past\\nages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience.\\nI had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of\\ncountry, mighty rivers, and boundless seas. But I was perfectly\\nunacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men. The cottage\\nof my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied\\nhuman nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of\\naction. I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or\\nmassacring their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue\\nrise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the\\nsignification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied\\nthem, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was\\nof course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and\\nLycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal\\nlives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold\\non my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been\\nmade by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should\\nhave been imbued with different sensations.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions. I\\nread it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my\\nhands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe\\nthat the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures\\nwas capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations,\\nas their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was\\napparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but\\nhis state was far different from mine in every other respect. He\\nhad come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and\\nprosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was\\nallowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a\\nsuperior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many\\ntimes I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for\\noften, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the\\nbitter gall of envy rose within me.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.\\nSoon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the\\npocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At\\nfirst I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the\\ncharacters in which they were written, I began to study them with\\ndiligence. It was your journal of the four months that preceded my\\ncreation. You minutely described in these papers every step you\\ntook in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with\\naccounts of domestic occurrences. You doubtless recollect these\\npapers. Here they are. Everything is related in them which bears\\nreference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of\\ndisgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the\\nminutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in\\nlanguage which painted your own horrors and rendered mine\\nindelible. I sickened as I read. \\'Hateful day when I received\\nlife!\\' I exclaimed in agony. \\'Accursed creator! Why did you form a\\nmonster so hideous that even <i>you</i> turned from me in disgust?\\nGod, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image;\\nbut my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the\\nvery resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to\\nadmire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and\\nsolitude; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers,\\ntheir amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that\\nwhen they should become acquainted with my admiration of their\\nvirtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal\\ndeformity. Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous,\\nwho solicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at\\nleast, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an\\ninterview with them which would decide my fate. I postponed this\\nattempt for some months longer, for the importance attached to its\\nsuccess inspired me with a dread lest I should fail. Besides, I\\nfound that my understanding improved so much with every day\\'s\\nexperience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until\\na few more months should have added to my sagacity.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage.\\nThe presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and\\nI also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix\\nand Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were\\nassisted in their labours by servants. They did not appear rich,\\nbut they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and\\npeaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of\\nknowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched\\noutcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I\\nbeheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine,\\neven as that frail image and that inconstant shade.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for\\nthe trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and\\nsometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in\\nthe fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely\\ncreatures sympathizing with my feelings and cheering my gloom;\\ntheir angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it\\nwas all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts;\\nI was alone. I remembered Adam\\'s supplication to his Creator. But\\nwhere was mine? He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my\\nheart I cursed him.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves\\ndecay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak\\nappearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely\\nmoon. Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better\\nfitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But\\nmy chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all\\nthe gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with\\nmore attention towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not\\ndecreased by the absence of summer. They loved and sympathized with\\none another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not\\ninterrupted by the casualties that took place around them. The more\\nI saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their\\nprotection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by\\nthese amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards\\nme with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition. I dared not\\nthink that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror.\\nThe poor that stopped at their door were never driven away. I\\nasked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or\\nrest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe\\nmyself utterly unworthy of it.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons\\nhad taken place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time\\nwas solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the\\ncottage of my protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on\\nwhich I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old\\nman should be alone. I had sagacity enough to discover that the\\nunnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror\\nwith those who had formerly beheld me. My voice, although harsh,\\nhad nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if in the\\nabsence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of\\nthe old De Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger\\nprotectors.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the\\nground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie,\\nAgatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man,\\nat his own desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children\\nhad departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but\\nsweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play\\nbefore. At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but\\nas he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length,\\nlaying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial,\\nwhich would decide my hopes or realize my fears. The servants were\\ngone to a neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the\\ncottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to\\nexecute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again\\nI rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master,\\nremoved the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my\\nretreat. The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I\\napproached the door of their cottage.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I knocked. \\'Who is there?\\' said the old man. \\'Come in.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I entered. \\'Pardon this intrusion,\\' said I; \\'I am a traveller\\nin want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would\\nallow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Enter,\\' said De Lacey, \\'and I will try in what manner I can to\\nrelieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home,\\nand as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure\\nfood for you.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is\\nwarmth and rest only that I need.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was\\nprecious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to\\ncommence the interview, when the old man addressed me. \\'By your\\nlanguage, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you\\nFrench?\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that\\nlanguage only. I am now going to claim the protection of some\\nfriends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some\\nhopes.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Are they Germans?\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an\\nunfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no\\nrelation or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go\\nhave never seen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for\\nif I fail there, I am an outcast in the world forever.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate,\\nbut the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious\\nself-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity. Rely,\\ntherefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and\\namiable, do not despair.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'They are kind&mdash;they are the most excellent creatures in\\nthe world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I\\nhave good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in\\nsome degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes,\\nand where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold\\nonly a detestable monster.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless,\\ncannot you undeceive them?\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account\\nthat I feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these\\nfriends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the\\nhabits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish\\nto injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to\\novercome.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Where do these friends reside?\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Near this spot.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The old man paused and then continued, \\'If you will\\nunreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps\\nmay be of use in undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of\\nyour countenance, but there is something in your words which\\npersuades me that you are sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it\\nwill afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a\\nhuman creature.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You\\nraise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your\\naid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your\\nfellow creatures.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can\\nonly drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I\\nalso am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although\\ninnocent; judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your\\nmisfortunes.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your\\nlips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me;\\nI shall be forever grateful; and your present humanity assures me\\nof success with those friends whom I am on the point of\\nmeeting.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'May I know the names and residence of those friends?\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which\\nwas to rob me of or bestow happiness on me forever. I struggled\\nvainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort\\ndestroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed\\naloud. At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I\\nhad not a moment to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I\\ncried, \\'Now is the time! Save and protect me! You and your family\\nare the friends whom I seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of\\ntrial!\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Great God!\\' exclaimed the old man. \\'Who are you?\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie,\\nand Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation\\non beholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her\\nfriend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with\\nsupernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung,\\nin a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me\\nviolently with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as\\nthe lion rends the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with\\nbitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw him on the point of\\nrepeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted\\nthe cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my\\nhovel.\"</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 16</h2>\\n\\n<p>\"Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant,\\ndid I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so\\nwantonly bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession\\nof me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with\\npleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have\\nglutted myself with their shrieks and misery.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood;\\nand now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent\\nto my anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had\\nbroken the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and\\nranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a\\nmiserable night I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the\\nbare trees waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet\\nvoice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All,\\nsave I, were at rest or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore\\na hell within me, and finding myself unsympathized with, wished to\\ntear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then\\nto have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I\\nbecame fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp\\ngrass in the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the\\nmyriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should\\nI feel kindness towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared\\neverlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him\\nwho had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable\\nmisery.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was\\nimpossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I\\nhid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the\\nensuing hours to reflection on my situation.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to\\nsome degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed\\nat the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too\\nhasty in my conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was\\napparent that my conversation had interested the father in my\\nbehalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror\\nof his children. I ought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to\\nme, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his\\nfamily, when they should have been prepared for my approach. But I\\ndid not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much\\nconsideration I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old\\nman, and by my representations win him to my party.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a\\nprofound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be\\nvisited by peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day\\nwas forever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the\\nenraged Felix tearing me from his father\\'s feet. I awoke exhausted,\\nand finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my\\nhiding-place, and went in search of food.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the\\nwell-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at\\npeace. I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of\\nthe accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the\\nsun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear.\\nI trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The\\ninside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot\\ndescribe the agony of this suspense.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the\\ncottage, they entered into conversation, using violent\\ngesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they\\nspoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my\\nprotectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man;\\nI was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that\\nmorning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the\\nmeaning of these unusual appearances.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Do you consider,\\' said his companion to him, \\'that you will be\\nobliged to pay three months\\' rent and to lose the produce of your\\ngarden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg\\ntherefore that you will take some days to consider of your\\ndetermination.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'It is utterly useless,\\' replied Felix; \\'we can never again\\ninhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest\\ndanger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My\\nwife and my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat\\nyou not to reason with me any more. Take possession of your\\ntenement and let me fly from this place.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion\\nentered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and\\nthen departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state\\nof utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had\\nbroken the only link that held me to the world. For the first time\\nthe feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not\\nstrive to control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the\\nstream, I bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of\\nmy friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of\\nAgatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts\\nvanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I\\nreflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a\\nrage of anger, and unable to injure anything human, I turned my\\nfury towards inanimate objects. As night advanced I placed a\\nvariety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having\\ndestroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with\\nforced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\\noperations.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and\\nquickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the\\nblast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of\\ninsanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and\\nreflection. I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury\\naround the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western\\nhorizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its\\norb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a\\nloud scream I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had\\ncollected. The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly\\nenveloped by the flames, which clung to it and licked it with their\\nforked and destroying tongues.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any\\npart of the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge\\nin the woods.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my\\nsteps? I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but\\nto me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible.\\nAt length the thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your\\npapers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I\\napply with more fitness than to him who had given me life? Among\\nthe lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie, geography had not\\nbeen omitted; I had learned from these the relative situations of\\nthe different countries of the earth. You had mentioned Geneva as\\nthe name of your native town, and towards this place I resolved to\\nproceed.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a\\nsouthwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\\nonly guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to\\npass through, nor could I ask information from a single human\\nbeing; but I did not despair. From you only could I hope for\\nsuccour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of\\nhatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! You had endowed me with\\nperceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the\\nscorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any claim for\\npity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice\\nwhich I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the\\nhuman form.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It\\nwas late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long\\nresided. I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the\\nvisage of a human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun\\nbecame heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were\\nfrozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and\\nI found no shelter. Oh, earth! How often did I imprecate curses on\\nthe cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all\\nwithin me was turned to gall and bitterness. The nearer I\\napproached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the\\nspirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters\\nwere hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now and then\\ndirected me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often\\nwandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no\\nrespite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could\\nnot extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I\\narrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered\\nits warmth and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an\\nespecial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was\\nsecured by night from the view of man. One morning, however,\\nfinding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to\\ncontinue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one\\nof the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its\\nsunshine and the balminess of the air. I felt emotions of\\ngentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within\\nme. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed\\nmyself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and\\ndeformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks,\\nand I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the\\nblessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came\\nto its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into\\nwhich many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the\\nfresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to\\npursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to\\nconceal myself under the shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid\\nwhen a young girl came running towards the spot where I was\\nconcealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport. She\\ncontinued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when\\nsuddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream. I\\nrushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the force\\nof the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She was\\nsenseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore\\nanimation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a\\nrustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully\\nfled. On seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from\\nmy arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed\\nspeedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he\\naimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the\\nground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the\\nwood.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human\\nbeing from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the\\nmiserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The\\nfeelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a\\nfew moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of\\nteeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to\\nall mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses\\npaused, and I fainted.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods,\\nendeavouring to cure the wound which I had received. The ball had\\nentered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there\\nor passed through; at any rate I had no means of extracting it. My\\nsufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the\\ninjustice and ingratitude of their infliction. My daily vows rose\\nfor revenge&mdash;a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone\\ncompensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.\\nThe labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright\\nsun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which\\ninsulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I\\nwas not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this\\ntime I reached the environs of Geneva.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place\\namong the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I\\nshould apply to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far\\ntoo unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect\\nof the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of\\nreflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful\\nchild, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the\\nsportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea\\nseized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived\\ntoo short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If,\\ntherefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and\\nfriend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and\\ndrew him towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his\\nhands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand\\nforcibly from his face and said, \\'Child, what is the meaning of\\nthis? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"He struggled violently. \\'Let me go,\\' he cried; \\'monster! Ugly\\nwretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You are an ogre.\\nLet me go, or I will tell my papa.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with\\nme.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic&mdash;he is M.\\nFrankenstein&mdash;he will punish you. You dare not keep me.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"\\'Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy&mdash;to him towards\\nwhom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first\\nvictim.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which\\ncarried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him,\\nand in a moment he lay dead at my feet.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and\\nhellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, \\'I too can create\\ndesolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry\\ndespair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and\\ndestroy him.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on\\nhis breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In\\nspite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few\\nmoments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep\\nlashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I\\nremembered that I was forever deprived of the delights that such\\nbeautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I\\ncontemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of\\ndivine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I\\nonly wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations\\nin exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish\\nin the attempt to destroy them.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I\\nhad committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place,\\nI entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was\\nsleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as\\nher whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming\\nin the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of\\nthose whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And\\nthen I bent over her and whispered, \\'Awake, fairest, thy lover is\\nnear&mdash;he who would give his life but to obtain one look of\\naffection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should\\nshe indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the\\nmurderer? Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened\\nand she beheld me. The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend\\nwithin me&mdash;not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have\\ncommitted because I am forever robbed of all that she could give\\nme, she shall atone. The crime had its source in her; be hers the\\npunishment! Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws\\nof man, I had learned now to work mischief. I bent over her and\\nplaced the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress. She\\nmoved again, and I fled.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken\\nplace, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the\\nworld and its miseries forever. At length I wandered towards these\\nmountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed\\nby a burning passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part\\nuntil you have promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone\\nand miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed\\nand horrible as myself would not deny herself to me. My companion\\nmust be of the same species and have the same defects. This being\\nyou must create.\"</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 17</h2>\\n\\n<p>The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the\\nexpectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable\\nto arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of\\nhis proposition. He continued,</p>\\n\\n<p>\"You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the\\ninterchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you\\nalone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not\\nrefuse to concede.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger\\nthat had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the\\ncottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage\\nthat burned within me.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I do refuse it,\" I replied; \"and no torture shall ever extort a\\nconsent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but\\nyou shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another\\nlike yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world.\\nBegone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never\\nconsent.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"You are in the wrong,\" replied the fiend; \"and instead of\\nthreatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious\\nbecause I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?\\nYou, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember\\nthat, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me? You\\nwould not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of\\nthose ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands.\\nShall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him live with me in\\nthe interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow\\nevery benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.\\nBut that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to\\nour union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery.\\nI will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause\\nfear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do\\nI swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your\\ndestruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you\\nshall curse the hour of your birth.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was\\nwrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold;\\nbut presently he calmed himself and proceeded&mdash;</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for\\nyou do not reflect that <i>you</i> are the cause of its excess. If\\nany being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return\\nthem a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature\\'s sake I\\nwould make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams\\nof bliss that cannot be realized. What I ask of you is reasonable\\nand moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as\\nmyself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can\\nreceive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters,\\ncut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more\\nattached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will\\nbe harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator,\\nmake me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit!\\nLet me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do\\nnot deny me my request!\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible\\nconsequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice\\nin his argument. His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved\\nhim to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker\\nowe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to\\nbestow? He saw my change of feeling and continued,</p>\\n\\n<p>\"If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall\\never see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My\\nfood is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to\\nglut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient\\nnourishment. My companion will be of the same nature as myself and\\nwill be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried\\nleaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food.\\nThe picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must\\nfeel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and\\ncruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion\\nin your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you\\nto promise what I so ardently desire.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"You propose,\" replied I, \"to fly from the habitations of man,\\nto dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your\\nonly companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of\\nman, persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their\\nkindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil\\npassions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid\\nyou in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to argue the\\npoint, for I cannot consent.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were\\nmoved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself\\nto my complaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and\\nby you that made me, that with the companion you bestow I will quit\\nthe neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most\\nsavage of places. My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet\\nwith sympathy! My life will flow quietly away, and in my dying\\nmoments I shall not curse my maker.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and\\nsometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him,\\nwhen I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened\\nand my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried\\nto stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not\\nsympathize with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small\\nportion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"You swear,\" I said, \"to be harmless; but have you not already\\nshown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust\\nyou? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph\\nby affording a wider scope for your revenge?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an\\nanswer. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must\\nbe my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my\\ncrimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will\\nbe ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I\\nabhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in\\ncommunion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive\\nbeing and become linked to the chain of existence and events from\\nwhich I am now excluded.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the\\nvarious arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise\\nof virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence\\nand the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and\\nscorn which his protectors had manifested towards him. His power\\nand threats were not omitted in my calculations; a creature who\\ncould exist in the ice caves of the glaciers and hide himself from\\npursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being\\npossessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long\\npause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him\\nand my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with\\nhis request. Turning to him, therefore, I said,</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe\\nforever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon\\nas I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you\\nin your exile.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I swear,\" he cried, \"by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven,\\nand by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my\\nprayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to\\nyour home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress\\nwith unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready\\nI shall appear.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any\\nchange in my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with\\ngreater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among\\nthe undulations of the sea of ice.</p>\\n\\n<p>His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the\\nverge of the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to\\nhasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be\\nencompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow.\\nThe labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and\\nfixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was\\nby the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced.\\nNight was far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and\\nseated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals as\\nthe clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me,\\nand every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground; it was a\\nscene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within\\nme. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed,\\n\"Oh! Stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye\\nreally pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as\\nnought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to\\nyou how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how\\nI listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc\\non its way to consume me.</p>\\n\\n<p>Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I\\ntook no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own\\nheart I could give no expression to my sensations&mdash;they\\nweighed on me with a mountain\\'s weight and their excess destroyed\\nmy agony beneath them. Thus I returned home, and entering the\\nhouse, presented myself to the family. My haggard and wild\\nappearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question,\\nscarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed under a\\nban&mdash;as if I had no right to claim their sympathies&mdash;as\\nif never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus\\nI loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate\\nmyself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation\\nmade every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a\\ndream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 18</h2>\\n\\n<p>Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to\\nGeneva; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work.\\nI feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable\\nto overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I\\nfound that I could not compose a female without again devoting\\nseveral months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had\\nheard of some discoveries having been made by an English\\nphilosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and\\nI sometimes thought of obtaining my father\\'s consent to visit\\nEngland for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay\\nand shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose\\nimmediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me. A change\\nindeed had taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto\\ndeclined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by\\nthe memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father\\nsaw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards\\nthe best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which\\nevery now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring\\nblackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I\\ntook refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on\\nthe lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening\\nto the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh\\nair and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of\\ncomposure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends\\nwith a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,\\ncalling me aside, thus addressed me,</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your\\nformer pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you\\nare still unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was\\nlost in conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea\\nstruck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it.\\nReserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down\\ntreble misery on us all.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father\\ncontinued&mdash;\"I confess, my son, that I have always looked\\nforward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our\\ndomestic comfort and the stay of my declining years. You were\\nattached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied\\ntogether, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited\\nto one another. But so blind is the experience of man that what I\\nconceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely\\ndestroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any\\nwish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with\\nanother whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in\\nhonour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery\\nwhich you appear to feel.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly\\nand sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth\\ndoes, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and\\nprospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our\\nunion.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear\\nVictor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time\\nexperienced. If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however\\npresent events may cast a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which\\nappears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to\\ndissipate. Tell me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate\\nsolemnization of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent\\nevents have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my\\nyears and infirmities. You are younger; yet I do not suppose,\\npossessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage\\nwould at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility\\nthat you may have formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to\\ndictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause\\nme any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words with candour and\\nanswer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time\\nincapable of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a\\nmultitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.\\nAlas! To me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was\\none of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I\\nhad not yet fulfilled and dared not break, or if I did, what\\nmanifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family!\\nCould I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging\\nround my neck and bowing me to the ground? I must perform my\\nengagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I\\nallowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which I\\nexpected peace.</p>\\n\\n<p>I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either\\njourneying to England or entering into a long correspondence with\\nthose philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries\\nwere of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking. The\\nlatter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory\\nand unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to\\nthe idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father\\'s\\nhouse while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved. I\\nknew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest\\nof which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with\\nhorror. I was aware also that I should often lose all self-command,\\nall capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess\\nme during the progress of my unearthly occupation. I must absent\\nmyself from all I loved while thus employed. Once commenced, it\\nwould quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family in\\npeace and happiness. My promise fulfilled, the monster would depart\\nforever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile\\noccur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery forever.</p>\\n\\n<p>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a\\nwish to visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this\\nrequest, I clothed my desires under a guise which excited no\\nsuspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily\\ninduced my father to comply. After so long a period of an absorbing\\nmelancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he\\nwas glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea\\nof such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied\\namusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to\\nmyself.</p>\\n\\n<p>The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few\\nmonths, or at most a year, was the period contemplated. One\\npaternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a\\ncompanion. Without previously communicating with me, he had, in\\nconcert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at\\nStrasbourg. This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the\\nprosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the\\npresence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I\\nrejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely,\\nmaddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between me and the\\nintrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times force\\nhis abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to\\ncontemplate its progress?</p>\\n\\n<p>To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that\\nmy union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.\\nMy father\\'s age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself,\\nthere was one reward I promised myself from my detested\\ntoils&mdash;one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was\\nthe prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable\\nslavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union\\nwith her.</p>\\n\\n<p>I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted\\nme which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I\\nshould leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy\\nand unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\\ndeparture. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go,\\nand would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was\\ndreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety\\nof my friends. I was agonized with the idea of the possibility that\\nthe reverse of this might happen. But through the whole period\\nduring which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be\\ngoverned by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations\\nstrongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my\\nfamily from the danger of his machinations.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my\\nnative country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and\\nElizabeth therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at\\nthe idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and\\ngrief. It had been her care which provided me a companion in\\nClerval&mdash;and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute\\ncircumstances which call forth a woman\\'s sedulous attention. She\\nlonged to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions\\nrendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell.</p>\\n\\n<p>I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away,\\nhardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was\\npassing around. I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish\\nthat I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments\\nshould be packed to go with me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I\\npassed through many beautiful and majestic scenes, but my eyes were\\nfixed and unobserving. I could only think of the bourne of my\\ntravels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they\\nendured.</p>\\n\\n<p>After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I\\ntraversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasbourg, where I waited two\\ndays for Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between\\nus! He was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the\\nbeauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise\\nand recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours\\nof the landscape and the appearances of the sky. \"This is what it\\nis to live,\" he cried; \"how I enjoy existence! But you, my dear\\nFrankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful!\" In\\ntruth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the\\ndescent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the\\nRhine. And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the\\njournal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling\\nand delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a miserable\\nwretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to\\nenjoyment.</p>\\n\\n<p>We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasbourg to\\nRotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this\\nvoyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful\\ntowns. We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our\\ndeparture from Strasbourg, arrived at Mainz. The course of the\\nRhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque. The river descends\\nrapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of\\nbeautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges\\nof precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible.\\nThis part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated\\nlandscape. In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles\\noverlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing\\nbeneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing\\nvineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and\\npopulous towns occupy the scene.</p>\\n\\n<p>We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of\\nthe labourers as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in\\nmind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even\\nI was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on\\nthe cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to\\nwhich I had long been a stranger. And if these were my sensations,\\nwho can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had been\\ntransported to fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by\\nman. \"I have seen,\" he said, \"the most beautiful scenes of my own\\ncountry; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the\\nsnowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water,\\ncasting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy\\nand mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands\\nthat believe the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake\\nagitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water\\nand gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great\\nocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where\\nthe priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and\\nwhere their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses\\nof the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and\\nthe Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than\\nall those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic\\nand strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river\\nthat I never before saw equalled. Look at that castle which\\noverhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost\\nconcealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that\\ngroup of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\\nhalf hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that\\ninhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man\\nthan those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks\\nof the mountains of our own country.\" Clerval! Beloved friend! Even\\nnow it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise\\nof which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in\\nthe \"very poetry of nature.\" His wild and enthusiastic imagination\\nwas chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed\\nwith ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and\\nwondrous nature that the world-minded teach us to look for only in\\nthe imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to\\nsatisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which\\nothers regard only with admiration, he loved with\\nardour:&mdash;</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>&mdash;The sounding cataract<br>\\nHaunted him like a passion: the tall rock,<br>\\nThe mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,<br>\\nTheir colours and their forms, were then to him<br>\\nAn appetite; a feeling, and a love,<br>\\nThat had no need of a remoter charm,<br>\\nBy thought supplied, or any interest<br>\\nUnborrow\\'d from the eye.<br>\\n<br>\\n[Wordsworth\\'s \"Tintern Abbey\".]</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being\\nlost forever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations\\nfanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence\\ndepended on the life of its creator;&mdash;has this mind perished?\\nDoes it now only exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form\\nso divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your\\nspirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.</p>\\n\\n<p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a\\nslight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my\\nheart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.\\nI will proceed with my tale.</p>\\n\\n<p>Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we\\nresolved to post the remainder of our way, for the wind was\\ncontrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us. Our\\njourney here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but\\nwe arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea\\nto England. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of\\nDecember, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks\\nof the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile,\\nand almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story.\\nWe saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend,\\nWoolwich, and Greenwich&mdash;places which I had heard of even in\\nmy country.</p>\\n\\n<p>At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul\\'s\\ntowering above all, and the Tower famed in English history.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 19</h2>\\n\\n<p>London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain\\nseveral months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval\\ndesired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who\\nflourished at this time, but this was with me a secondary object; I\\nwas principally occupied with the means of obtaining the\\ninformation necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly\\navailed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought\\nwith me, addressed to the most distinguished natural\\nphilosophers.</p>\\n\\n<p>If this journey had taken place during my days of study and\\nhappiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a\\nblight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people\\nfor the sake of the information they might give me on the subject\\nin which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome\\nto me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven\\nand earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat\\nmyself into a transitory peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous\\nfaces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable\\nbarrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was\\nsealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the\\nevents connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.</p>\\n\\n<p>But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was\\ninquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The\\ndifference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible\\nsource of instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object\\nhe had long had in view. His design was to visit India, in the\\nbelief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and\\nin the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially\\nassisting the progress of European colonization and trade. In\\nBritain only could he further the execution of his plan. He was\\nforever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful\\nand dejected mind. I tried to conceal this as much as possible,\\nthat I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who\\nwas entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or\\nbitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging\\nanother engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to\\ncollect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was\\nto me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling\\non the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme\\nanguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my\\nlips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.</p>\\n\\n<p>After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a\\nperson in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He\\nmentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those\\nwere not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey\\nas far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to\\naccept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished\\nto view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with\\nwhich Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places. We had arrived in\\nEngland at the beginning of October, and it was now February. We\\naccordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at\\nthe expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not\\nintend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor,\\nOxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at\\nthe completion of this tour about the end of July. I packed up my\\nchemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving\\nto finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands\\nof Scotland.</p>\\n\\n<p>We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days\\nat Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene\\nto us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and\\nthe herds of stately deer were all novelties to us.</p>\\n\\n<p>From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city our\\nminds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been\\ntransacted there more than a century and a half before. It was here\\nthat Charles I. had collected his forces. This city had remained\\nfaithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to\\njoin the standard of Parliament and liberty. The memory of that\\nunfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the\\ninsolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to\\nevery part of the city which they might be supposed to have\\ninhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we\\ndelighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found\\nan imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in\\nitself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are\\nancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and\\nthe lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite\\nverdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which\\nreflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes,\\nembosomed among aged trees.</p>\\n\\n<p>I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both\\nby the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was\\nformed for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent\\nnever visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by ennui, the\\nsight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is\\nexcellent and sublime in the productions of man could always\\ninterest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I\\nam a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then\\nthat I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to\\nbe&mdash;a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to\\nothers and intolerable to myself.</p>\\n\\n<p>We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its\\nenvirons and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate\\nto the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages\\nof discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that\\npresented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious\\nHampden and the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my\\nsoul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to\\ncontemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self sacrifice of which\\nthese sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. For an\\ninstant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a\\nfree and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I\\nsank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.</p>\\n\\n<p>We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was\\nour next place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this\\nvillage resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland;\\nbut everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the\\ncrown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny\\nmountains of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave and\\nthe little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are\\ndisposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and\\nChamounix. The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by\\nHenry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible\\nscene was thus associated.</p>\\n\\n<p>From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\\nCumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among\\nthe Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered\\non the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing\\nof the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here\\nalso we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me\\ninto happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater\\nthan mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and\\nhe found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he\\ncould have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated\\nwith his inferiors. \"I could pass my life here,\" said he to me;\\n\"and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and\\nthe Rhine.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>But he found that a traveller\\'s life is one that includes much\\npain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are forever on the\\nstretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself\\nobliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something\\nnew, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes\\nfor other novelties.</p>\\n\\n<p>We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and\\nWestmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants\\nwhen the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend\\napproached, and we left them to travel on. For my own part I was\\nnot sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I\\nfeared the effects of the daemon\\'s disappointment. He might remain\\nin Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. This idea\\npursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might\\notherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters\\nwith feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and\\novercome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the\\nsuperscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read\\nand ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed\\nme and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When\\nthese thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,\\nbut followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied\\nrage of his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great\\ncrime, the consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but\\nI had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as\\nthat of crime.</p>\\n\\n<p>I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that\\ncity might have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did\\nnot like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city\\nwas more pleasing to him. But the beauty and regularity of the new\\ntown of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most\\ndelightful in the world, Arthur\\'s Seat, St. Bernard\\'s Well, and the\\nPentland Hills compensated him for the change and filled him with\\ncheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to arrive at the\\ntermination of my journey.</p>\\n\\n<p>We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St.\\nAndrew\\'s, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our\\nfriend expected us. But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with\\nstrangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good\\nhumour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I\\nwished to make the tour of Scotland alone. \"Do you,\" said I, \"enjoy\\nyourself, and let this be our rendezvous. I may be absent a month\\nor two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you; leave\\nme to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I\\nhope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own\\ntemper.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan,\\nceased to remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. \"I had\\nrather be with you,\" he said, \"in your solitary rambles, than with\\nthese Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear\\nfriend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home,\\nwhich I cannot do in your absence.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote\\nspot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt\\nbut that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me\\nwhen I should have finished, that he might receive his companion.\\nWith this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed\\non one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.\\nIt was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a\\nrock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves.\\nThe soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable\\ncows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five\\npersons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their\\nmiserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such\\nluxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the\\nmainland, which was about five miles distant.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one\\nof these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but\\ntwo rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most\\nmiserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were\\nunplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be\\nrepaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an incident\\nwhich would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the\\nsenses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty.\\nAs it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for\\nthe pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does\\nsuffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.</p>\\n\\n<p>In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the\\nevening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of\\nthe sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my\\nfeet. It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of\\nSwitzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling\\nlandscape. Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are\\nscattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and\\ngentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as\\nthe play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the\\ngiant ocean.</p>\\n\\n<p>In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first\\narrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more\\nhorrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself\\nto enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I\\ntoiled day and night in order to complete my work. It was, indeed,\\na filthy process in which I was engaged. During my first\\nexperiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the\\nhorror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the\\nconsummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of\\nmy proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart\\noften sickened at the work of my hands.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation,\\nimmersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my\\nattention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits\\nbecame unequal; I grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared\\nto meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the\\nground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object\\nwhich I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the\\nsight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to\\nclaim his companion.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already\\nconsiderably advanced. I looked towards its completion with a\\ntremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to\\nquestion but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil\\nthat made my heart sicken in my bosom.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 20</h2>\\n\\n<p>I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the\\nmoon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for\\nmy employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of\\nwhether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its\\nconclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I sat, a train of\\nreflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of\\nwhat I was now doing. Three years before, I was engaged in the same\\nmanner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had\\ndesolated my heart and filled it forever with the bitterest\\nremorse. I was now about to form another being of whose\\ndispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand\\ntimes more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake,\\nin murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood\\nof man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, who\\nin all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal,\\nmight refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation.\\nThey might even hate each other; the creature who already lived\\nloathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater\\nabhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form?\\nShe also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of\\nman; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the\\nfresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species. Even\\nif they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new\\nworld, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which\\nthe daemon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would\\nbe propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of\\nthe species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I\\nright, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting\\ngenerations? I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I\\nhad created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats;\\nbut now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst\\nupon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as\\ntheir pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own\\npeace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human\\nrace.</p>\\n\\n<p>I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I\\nsaw by the light of the moon the daemon at the casement. A ghastly\\ngrin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling\\nthe task which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my\\ntravels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken\\nrefuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my\\nprogress and claim the fulfilment of my promise.</p>\\n\\n<p>As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent\\nof malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on\\nmy promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with\\npassion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The\\nwretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he\\ndepended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and\\nrevenge, withdrew.</p>\\n\\n<p>I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my\\nown heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling\\nsteps, I sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to\\ndissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of\\nthe most terrible reveries.</p>\\n\\n<p>Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on\\nthe sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and\\nall nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing\\nvessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze\\nwafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another.\\nI felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme\\nprofundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of\\noars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house.</p>\\n\\n<p>In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if\\nsome one endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to\\nfoot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one\\nof the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was\\novercome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in\\nfrightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an\\nimpending danger, and was rooted to the spot. Presently I heard the\\nsound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the\\nwretch whom I dreaded appeared.</p>\\n\\n<p>Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered\\nvoice, \"You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it\\nthat you intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured\\ntoil and misery; I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the\\nshores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits\\nof its hills. I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and\\namong the deserts of Scotland. I have endured incalculable fatigue,\\nand cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like\\nyourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\\nunworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you\\nbelieve yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the\\nlight of day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am\\nyour master; obey!\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your\\npower is arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of\\nwickedness; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating\\nyou a companion in vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the\\nearth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone!\\nI am firm, and your words will only exasperate my rage.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his\\nteeth in the impotence of anger. \"Shall each man,\" cried he, \"find\\na wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?\\nI had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation\\nand scorn. Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in\\ndread and misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish\\nfrom you your happiness forever. Are you to be happy while I grovel\\nin the intensity of my wretchedness? You can blast my other\\npassions, but revenge remains&mdash;revenge, henceforth dearer than\\nlight or food! I may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor,\\nshall curse the sun that gazes on your misery. Beware, for I am\\nfearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with the wiliness of\\na snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of\\nthe injuries you inflict.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of\\nmalice. I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to\\nbend beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your\\nwedding-night.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I started forward and exclaimed, \"Villain! Before you sign my\\ndeath-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house\\nwith precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which\\nshot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost\\namidst the waves.</p>\\n\\n<p>All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned\\nwith rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him\\ninto the ocean. I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed,\\nwhile my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and\\nsting me. Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal\\nstrife? But I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his\\ncourse towards the mainland. I shuddered to think who might be the\\nnext victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge. And then I thought\\nagain of his words&mdash;\"<i>I will be with you on your\\nwedding-night</i>.\" That, then, was the period fixed for the\\nfulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once\\nsatisfy and extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to\\nfear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and\\nendless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously\\nsnatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months,\\nstreamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy\\nwithout a bitter struggle.</p>\\n\\n<p>The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my\\nfeelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the\\nviolence of rage sinks into the depths of despair. I left the\\nhouse, the horrid scene of the last night\\'s contention, and walked\\non the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable\\nbarrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such\\nshould prove the fact stole across me.</p>\\n\\n<p>I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock,\\nwearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of\\nmisery. If I returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom\\nI most loved die under the grasp of a daemon whom I had myself\\ncreated.</p>\\n\\n<p>I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from\\nall it loved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon,\\nand the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was\\noverpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake the whole of the\\npreceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by\\nwatching and misery. The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me;\\nand when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human\\nbeings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed\\nwith greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my\\nears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct\\nand oppressive as a reality.</p>\\n\\n<p>The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore,\\nsatisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten\\ncake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the\\nmen brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one\\nfrom Clerval entreating me to join him. He said that he was wearing\\naway his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the\\nfriends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the\\nnegotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. He\\ncould not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to\\nLondon might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by\\nhis longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my society\\non him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to leave my\\nsolitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\\nsouthwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life,\\nand I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.\\nYet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I\\nshuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and\\nfor that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of\\nmy odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of which\\nwas sickening to me. The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned\\nsufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory. The\\nremains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay\\nscattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the\\nliving flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and then\\nentered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\\nout of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the\\nrelics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the\\npeasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great\\nquantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them\\ninto the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the\\nbeach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical\\napparatus.</p>\\n\\n<p>Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had\\ntaken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the\\ndaemon. I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a\\nthing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I\\nnow felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I\\nfor the first time saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did\\nnot for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on\\nmy thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine\\ncould avert it. I had resolved in my own mind that to create\\nanother like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the\\nbasest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind\\nevery thought that could lead to a different conclusion.</p>\\n\\n<p>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then,\\nputting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four\\nmiles from the shore. The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats\\nwere returning towards land, but I sailed away from them. I felt as\\nif I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with\\nshuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures. At one\\ntime the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread\\nby a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness\\nand cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\\nas it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became\\nclouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast\\nbreeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with\\nsuch agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the\\nwater, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself\\nat the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon, everything was\\nobscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut\\nthrough the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\\nslept soundly. I do not know how long I remained in this situation,\\nbut when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted\\nconsiderably. The wind was high, and the waves continually\\nthreatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was\\nnortheast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I\\nhad embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\\nthat if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled\\nwith water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the\\nwind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no\\ncompass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography\\nof this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me.\\nI might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures\\nof starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that\\nroared and buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours\\nand felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other\\nsufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\\nthat flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked\\nupon the sea; it was to be my grave. \"Fiend,\" I exclaimed, \"your\\ntask is already fulfilled!\" I thought of Elizabeth, of my father,\\nand of Clerval&mdash;all left behind, on whom the monster might\\nsatisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me\\ninto a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the\\nscene is on the point of closing before me forever, I shudder to\\nreflect on it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined\\ntowards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and\\nthe sea became free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy\\nswell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, when\\nsuddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south.</p>\\n\\n<p>Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I\\nendured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed\\nlike a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my\\neyes.</p>\\n\\n<p>How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging\\nlove we have of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed\\nanother sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course\\ntowards the land. It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I\\napproached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation. I\\nsaw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported\\nback to the neighbourhood of civilized man. I carefully traced the\\nwindings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw\\nissuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of\\nextreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as\\na place where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately\\nI had money with me.</p>\\n\\n<p>As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a\\ngood harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my\\nunexpected escape.</p>\\n\\n<p>As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails,\\nseveral people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised\\nat my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance,\\nwhispered together with gestures that at any other time might have\\nproduced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely\\nremarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in\\nthat language. \"My good friends,\" said I, \"will you be so kind as\\nto tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"You will know that soon enough,\" replied a man with a hoarse\\nvoice. \"Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to\\nyour taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I\\npromise you.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from\\na stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning\\nand angry countenances of his companions. \"Why do you answer me so\\nroughly?\" I replied. \"Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\\nreceive strangers so inhospitably.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I do not know,\" said the man, \"what the custom of the English\\nmay be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.\" While\\nthis strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\\nincrease. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger,\\nwhich annoyed and in some degree alarmed me.</p>\\n\\n<p>I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied. I then moved\\nforward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they\\nfollowed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching\\ntapped me on the shoulder and said, \"Come, sir, you must follow me\\nto Mr. Kirwin\\'s to give an account of yourself.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is\\nnot this a free country?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a\\nmagistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a\\ngentleman who was found murdered here last night.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was\\ninnocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my\\nconductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the\\ntown. I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being\\nsurrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my\\nstrength, that no physical debility might be construed into\\napprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the\\ncalamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish\\nin horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death. I must pause\\nhere, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the\\nfrightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to\\nmy recollection.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 21</h2>\\n\\n<p>I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an\\nold benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me,\\nhowever, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my\\nconductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this\\noccasion.</p>\\n\\n<p>About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by\\nthe magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night\\nbefore with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about\\nten o\\'clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and\\nthey accordingly put in for port. It was a very dark night, as the\\nmoon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as\\nthey had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He\\nwalked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his\\ncompanions followed him at some distance.</p>\\n\\n<p>As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against\\nsomething and fell at his length on the ground. His companions came\\nup to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that\\nhe had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead.\\nTheir first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person\\nwho had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on\\nexamination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that\\nthe body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the\\ncottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain,\\nto restore it to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man,\\nabout five and twenty years of age. He had apparently been\\nstrangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black\\nmark of fingers on his neck.</p>\\n\\n<p>The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest\\nme, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the\\nmurder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs\\ntrembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on\\na chair for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and\\nof course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.</p>\\n\\n<p>The son confirmed his father\\'s account, but when Daniel Nugent\\nwas called he swore positively that just before the fall of his\\ncompanion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short\\ndistance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light\\nof a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed. A\\nwoman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the\\ndoor of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about\\nan hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw\\na boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore\\nwhere the corpse was afterwards found.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having\\nbrought the body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into\\na bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary,\\nbut life was quite gone.</p>\\n\\n<p>Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they\\nagreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the\\nnight, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours\\nand had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I\\nhad departed. Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had\\nbrought the body from another place, and it was likely that as I\\ndid not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour\\nignorant of the distance of the town of &mdash;&mdash; from the\\nplace where I had deposited the corpse.</p>\\n\\n<p>Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be\\ntaken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might\\nbe observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This\\nidea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had\\nexhibited when the mode of the murder had been described. I was\\naccordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons,\\nto the inn. I could not help being struck by the strange\\ncoincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\\nknowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the\\nisland I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found,\\nI was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair. I\\nentered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin.\\nHow can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet\\nparched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment\\nwithout shuddering and agony. The examination, the presence of the\\nmagistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when I\\nsaw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me. I\\ngasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed,\\n\"Have my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest\\nHenry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other victims await\\ntheir destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\\nbenefactor&mdash;\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I\\nendured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions. A\\nfever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of\\ndeath; my ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called\\nmyself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval.\\nSometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction\\nof the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others I felt the\\nfingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud\\nwith agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native language,\\nMr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries\\nwere sufficient to affright the other witnesses. Why did I not die?\\nMore miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into\\nforgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children,\\nthe only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\\nyouthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope,\\nand the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what\\nmaterials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks,\\nwhich, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the\\ntorture?</p>\\n\\n<p>But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as\\nawaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed,\\nsurrounded by jailers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable\\napparatus of a dungeon. It was morning, I remember, when I thus\\nawoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had\\nhappened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly\\noverwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows\\nand the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across\\nmy memory and I groaned bitterly.</p>\\n\\n<p>This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair\\nbeside me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys,\\nand her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often\\ncharacterize that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude,\\nlike that of persons accustomed to see without sympathizing in\\nsights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she\\naddressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had\\nheard during my sufferings. \"Are you better now, sir?\" said\\nshe.</p>\\n\\n<p>I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, \"I believe\\nI am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry\\nthat I am still alive to feel this misery and horror.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"For that matter,\" replied the old woman, \"if you mean about the\\ngentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if\\nyou were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However,\\nthat\\'s none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you\\nwell; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if\\neverybody did the same.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so\\nunfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of\\ndeath; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had\\npassed. The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I\\nsometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never\\npresented itself to my mind with the force of reality.</p>\\n\\n<p>As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I\\ngrew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who\\nsoothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported\\nme. The physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman\\nprepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the\\nfirst, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the\\nvisage of the second. Who could be interested in the fate of a\\nmurderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?</p>\\n\\n<p>These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr.\\nKirwin had shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room\\nin the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best);\\nand it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true,\\nhe seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to\\nrelieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to\\nbe present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer. He\\ncame, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his\\nvisits were short and with long intervals. One day, while I was\\ngradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open\\nand my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\\nand misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire\\nto remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At\\none time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty\\nand suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine\\nhad been. Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was\\nopened and Mr. Kirwin entered. His countenance expressed sympathy\\nand compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in\\nFrench, \"I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do\\nanything to make you more comfortable?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the\\nwhole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of\\nreceiving.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little\\nrelief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But\\nyou will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless\\nevidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal\\ncharge.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events,\\nbecome the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I\\nam and have been, can death be any evil to me?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the\\nstrange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some\\nsurprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\\nseized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that\\nwas presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in\\nso unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend\\nacross your path.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured\\non this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable\\nsurprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I\\nsuppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr.\\nKirwin hastened to say, \"Immediately upon your being taken ill, all\\nthe papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined\\nthem that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your\\nrelations an account of your misfortune and illness. I found\\nseveral letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its\\ncommencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote to Geneva;\\nnearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\\nBut you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation\\nof any kind.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible\\nevent; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose\\nmurder I am now to lament?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Your family is perfectly well,\" said Mr. Kirwin with\\ngentleness; \"and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself,\\nbut it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to\\nmock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new\\nincitement for me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand\\nbefore my eyes, and cried out in agony, \"Oh! Take him away! I\\ncannot see him; for God\\'s sake, do not let him enter!\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not\\nhelp regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said\\nin rather a severe tone, \"I should have thought, young man, that\\nthe presence of your father would have been welcome instead of\\ninspiring such violent repugnance.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"My father!\" cried I, while every feature and every muscle was\\nrelaxed from anguish to pleasure. \"Is my father indeed come? How\\nkind, how very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to\\nme?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate;\\nperhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary\\nreturn of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former\\nbenevolence. He rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a\\nmoment my father entered it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure\\nthan the arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and\\ncried, \"Are you, then, safe&mdash;and Elizabeth&mdash;and Ernest?\"\\nMy father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and\\nendeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my\\nheart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a\\nprison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!\" said he,\\nlooking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of\\nthe room. \"You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to\\npursue you. And poor Clerval&mdash;\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation\\ntoo great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears. \"Alas! Yes,\\nmy father,\" replied I; \"some destiny of the most horrible kind\\nhangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should\\nhave died on the coffin of Henry.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\\nprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary\\nthat could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted\\nthat my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But\\nthe appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel,\\nand I gradually recovered my health.</p>\\n\\n<p>As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\\nmelancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was\\nforever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the\\nagitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends\\ndread a dangerous relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable\\nand detested a life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny,\\nwhich is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death\\nextinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight\\nof anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award\\nof justice, I shall also sink to rest. Then the appearance of death\\nwas distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and\\nI often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some\\nmighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its\\nruins.</p>\\n\\n<p>The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three\\nmonths in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual\\ndanger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles\\nto the country town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged\\nhimself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my\\ndefence. I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a\\ncriminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides\\non life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being\\nproved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my\\nfriend was found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated\\nfrom prison.</p>\\n\\n<p>My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations\\nof a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\\natmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not\\nparticipate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or\\na palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned forever,\\nand although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of\\nheart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness,\\npenetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon\\nme. Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing\\nin death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long\\nblack lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery,\\nclouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at\\nIngolstadt.</p>\\n\\n<p>My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He\\ntalked of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and\\nErnest; but these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes,\\nindeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy\\ndelight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring maladie du\\npays, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been\\nso dear to me in early childhood; but my general state of feeling\\nwas a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the\\ndivinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted\\nbut by paroxysms of anguish and despair. At these moments I often\\nendeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed, and it\\nrequired unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from\\ncommitting some dreadful act of violence.</p>\\n\\n<p>Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\\ntriumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should\\nreturn without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of\\nthose I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that\\nif any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he\\ndared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing\\naim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I had\\nendued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father\\nstill desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not\\nsustain the fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered\\nwreck&mdash;the shadow of a human being. My strength was gone. I\\nwas a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted\\nframe. Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude\\nand impatience, my father thought it best to yield. We took our\\npassage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with\\na fair wind from the Irish shores. It was midnight. I lay on the\\ndeck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the\\nwaves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and\\nmy pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\\nsoon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a\\nfrightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew\\nme from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded\\nme told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that\\nClerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me\\nand the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole\\nlife&mdash;my quiet happiness while residing with my family in\\nGeneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I\\nremembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to\\nthe creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\\nwhich he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought;\\na thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly. Ever\\nsince my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking\\nevery night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of\\nthis drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for\\nthe preservation of life. Oppressed by the recollection of my\\nvarious misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and\\nsoon slept profoundly. But sleep did not afford me respite from\\nthought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that\\nscared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare;\\nI felt the fiend\\'s grasp in my neck and could not free myself from\\nit; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was watching\\nover me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\\nwere around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense\\nof security, a feeling that a truce was established between the\\npresent hour and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me\\na kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its\\nstructure peculiarly susceptible.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 22</h2>\\n\\n<p>The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I\\nsoon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose\\nbefore I could continue my journey. My father\\'s care and attentions\\nwere indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings\\nand sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished\\nme to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh,\\nnot abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt\\nattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of\\nan angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no\\nright to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among\\nthem whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their\\ngroans. How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the\\nworld did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had\\ntheir source in me!</p>\\n\\n<p>My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and\\nstrove by various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he\\nthought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to\\nanswer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the\\nfutility of pride.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Alas! My father,\" said I, \"how little do you know me. Human\\nbeings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if\\nsuch a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was\\nas innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for\\nit; and I am the cause of this&mdash;I murdered her. William,\\nJustine, and Henry&mdash;they all died by my hands.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the\\nsame assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to\\ndesire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as\\nthe offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea\\nof this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the\\nremembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence.</p>\\n\\n<p>I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence\\nconcerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I\\nshould be supposed mad, and this in itself would forever have\\nchained my tongue. But, besides, I could not bring myself to\\ndisclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and\\nmake fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast. I\\nchecked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent\\nwhen I would have given the world to have confided the fatal\\nsecret. Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst\\nuncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but\\ntheir truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe. Upon\\nthis occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded\\nwonder, \"My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son,\\nI entreat you never to make such an assertion again.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I am not mad,\" I cried energetically; \"the sun and the heavens,\\nwho have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am\\nthe assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my\\nmachinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop\\nby drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father,\\nindeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas\\nwere deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our\\nconversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He\\nwished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes\\nthat had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or\\nsuffered me to speak of my misfortunes.</p>\\n\\n<p>As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling\\nin my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner\\nof my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.\\nBy the utmost self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of\\nwretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the\\nwhole world, and my manners were calmer and more composed than they\\nhad ever been since my journey to the sea of ice. A few days before\\nwe left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the following\\nletter from Elizabeth:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\"My dear Friend,<br>\\n<br>\\n\"It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle\\ndated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I\\nmay hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how\\nmuch you must have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more\\nill than when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most\\nmiserably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope\\nto see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not\\ntotally void of comfort and tranquillity.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so\\nmiserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not\\ndisturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon\\nyou, but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his\\ndeparture renders some explanation necessary before we meet.\\nExplanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to\\nexplain? If you really say this, my questions are answered and all\\nmy doubts satisfied. But you are distant from me, and it is\\npossible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this\\nexplanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare\\nnot any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have\\noften wished to express to you but have never had the courage to\\nbegin.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan\\nof your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when\\nyoung, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would\\ncertainly take place. We were affectionate playfellows during\\nchildhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another\\nas we grew older. But as brother and sister often entertain a\\nlively affection towards each other without desiring a more\\nintimate union, may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest\\nVictor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with\\nsimple truth&mdash;Do you not love another?<br>\\n<br>\\n\"You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at\\nIngolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you\\nlast autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of\\nevery creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret\\nour connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the\\nwishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your\\ninclinations. But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my\\nfriend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you\\nhave been my constant friend and companion. But it is your\\nhappiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our\\nmarriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the\\ndictate of your own free choice. Even now I weep to think that,\\nborne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle,\\nby the word \\'honour,\\' all hope of that love and happiness which\\nwould alone restore you to yourself. I, who have so disinterested\\nan affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being\\nan obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured that your cousin\\nand playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made\\nmiserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you obey\\nme in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth will\\nhave the power to interrupt my tranquillity.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the\\nnext day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My\\nuncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile\\non your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion\\nof mine, I shall need no other happiness.<br>\\n<br>\\n\"Elizabeth Lavenza<br>\\n\"Geneva, May 18th, 17&mdash;\"</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten,\\nthe threat of the fiend&mdash;\"<i>I will be with you on your\\nwedding-night</i>!\" Such was my sentence, and on that night would\\nthe daemon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the\\nglimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my\\nsufferings. On that night he had determined to consummate his\\ncrimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then\\nassuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be at\\npeace and his power over me be at an end. If he were vanquished, I\\nshould be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the peasant\\nenjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his\\ncottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift,\\nhomeless, penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty\\nexcept that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced\\nby those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until\\ndeath.</p>\\n\\n<p>Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and\\nsome softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper\\nparadisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already\\neaten, and the angel\\'s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I\\nwould die to make her happy. If the monster executed his threat,\\ndeath was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my marriage\\nwould hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed arrive a few\\nmonths sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed\\nit, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other and\\nperhaps more dreadful means of revenge.</p>\\n\\n<p>He had vowed <i>to be with me on my wedding-night</i>, yet he\\ndid not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the\\nmeantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with\\nblood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of\\nhis threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with\\nmy cousin would conduce either to hers or my father\\'s happiness, my\\nadversary\\'s designs against my life should not retard it a single\\nhour.</p>\\n\\n<p>In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm\\nand affectionate. \"I fear, my beloved girl,\" I said, \"little\\nhappiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy\\nis centred in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I\\nconsecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment. I have one\\nsecret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will\\nchill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at\\nmy misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured.\\nI will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after\\nour marriage shall take place, for, my sweet cousin, there must be\\nperfect confidence between us. But until then, I conjure you, do\\nnot mention or allude to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I\\nknow you will comply.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth\\'s letter we\\nreturned to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection,\\nyet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and\\nfeverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner and\\nhad lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me;\\nbut her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit\\ncompanion for one blasted and miserable as I was. The tranquillity\\nwhich I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness with it,\\nand when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed\\nme; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and\\ndespondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat\\nmotionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame\\nme.</p>\\n\\n<p>Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her\\ngentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and\\ninspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with\\nme and for me. When reason returned, she would remonstrate and\\nendeavour to inspire me with resignation. Ah! It is well for the\\nunfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace.\\nThe agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise\\nsometimes found in indulging the excess of grief. Soon after my\\narrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth. I\\nremained silent.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Have you, then, some other attachment?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union\\nwith delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will\\nconsecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my\\ncousin.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have\\nbefallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and\\ntransfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet\\nlive. Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of\\naffection and mutual misfortune. And when time shall have softened\\nyour despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace\\nthose of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of\\nthe threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the\\nfiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard\\nhim as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words \"<i>I\\nshall be with you on your wedding-night</i>,\" I should regard the\\nthreatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the\\nloss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a\\ncontented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that\\nif my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten\\ndays, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.</p>\\n\\n<p>Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the\\nhellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have\\nbanished myself forever from my native country and wandered a\\nfriendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this\\nmiserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic powers, the\\nmonster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought\\nthat I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far\\ndearer victim.</p>\\n\\n<p>As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from\\ncowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.\\nBut I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that\\nbrought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly\\ndeceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked\\nforward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a\\nlittle fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now\\nappeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into\\nan airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.\\nPreparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were\\nreceived, and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as\\nI could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered\\nwith seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they\\nmight only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. Through my\\nfather\\'s exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been\\nrestored to her by the Austrian government. A small possession on\\nthe shores of Como belonged to her. It was agreed that, immediately\\nafter our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our\\nfirst days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it\\nstood.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in\\ncase the fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a\\ndagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent\\nartifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of\\ntranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared\\nmore as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my\\npeace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a\\ngreater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its\\nsolemnization drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as\\nan occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.</p>\\n\\n<p>Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed\\ngreatly to calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my\\nwishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of\\nevil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful\\nsecret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day.\\nMy father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of\\npreparation only recognized in the melancholy of his niece the\\ndiffidence of a bride.</p>\\n\\n<p>After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my\\nfather\\'s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence\\nour journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing\\nour voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind\\nfavourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.</p>\\n\\n<p>Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed\\nthe feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot,\\nbut we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we\\nenjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake,\\nwhere we saw Mont Saleve, the pleasant banks of Montalegre, and at\\na distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc and the\\nassemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate\\nher; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura\\nopposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native\\ncountry, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who\\nshould wish to enslave it.</p>\\n\\n<p>I took the hand of Elizabeth. \"You are sorrowful, my love. Ah!\\nIf you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you\\nwould endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair\\nthat this one day at least permits me to enjoy.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Be happy, my dear Victor,\" replied Elizabeth; \"there is, I\\nhope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy\\nis not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something\\nwhispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is\\nopened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice.\\nObserve how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes\\nobscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render\\nthis scene of beauty still more interesting. Look also at the\\ninnumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we\\ncan distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a divine\\nday! How happy and serene all nature appears!\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from\\nall reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was\\nfluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it\\ncontinually gave place to distraction and reverie.</p>\\n\\n<p>The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance\\nand observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the\\nglens of the lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake,\\nand we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its\\neastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that\\nsurrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it\\nwas overhung.</p>\\n\\n<p>The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing\\nrapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just\\nruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as\\nwe approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful\\nscent of flowers and hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we\\nlanded, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears\\nrevive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me forever.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 23</h2>\\n\\n<p>It was eight o\\'clock when we landed; we walked for a short time\\non the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to\\nthe inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and\\nmountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black\\noutlines.</p>\\n\\n<p>The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great\\nviolence in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the\\nheavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it\\nswifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while\\nthe lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still\\nbusier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly\\na heavy storm of rain descended.</p>\\n\\n<p>I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured\\nthe shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was\\nanxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which\\nwas hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved\\nthat I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict\\nuntil my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished.\\nElizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful\\nsilence, but there was something in my glance which communicated\\nterror to her, and trembling, she asked, \"What is it that agitates\\nyou, my dear Victor? What is it you fear?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Oh! Peace, peace, my love,\" replied I; \"this night, and all\\nwill be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I\\nreflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would\\nbe to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving\\nnot to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the\\nsituation of my enemy.</p>\\n\\n<p>She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the\\npassages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford\\na retreat to my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was\\nbeginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened\\nto prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a\\nshrill and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which\\nElizabeth had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into\\nmy mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was\\nsuspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and\\ntingling in the extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but for\\nan instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room.\\nGreat God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the\\ndestruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She\\nwas there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head\\nhanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by\\nher hair. Everywhere I turn I see the same figure&mdash;her\\nbloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal\\nbier. Could I behold this and live? Alas! Life is obstinate and\\nclings closest where it is most hated. For a moment only did I lose\\nrecollection; I fell senseless on the ground.</p>\\n\\n<p>When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the\\ninn; their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the\\nhorror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the\\nfeelings that oppressed me. I escaped from them to the room where\\nlay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so\\ndear, so worthy. She had been moved from the posture in which I had\\nfirst beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a\\nhandkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed\\nher asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but\\nthe deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I\\nnow held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved\\nand cherished. The murderous mark of the fiend\\'s grasp was on her\\nneck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips. While I\\nstill hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\\nThe windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind\\nof panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the\\nchamber. The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of\\nhorror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the\\nmost hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster;\\nhe seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards\\nthe corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the window, and drawing a\\npistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his\\nstation, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into\\nthe lake.</p>\\n\\n<p>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I\\npointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the\\ntrack with boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing\\nseveral hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions\\nbelieving it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy. After\\nhaving landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going\\nin different directions among the woods and vines.</p>\\n\\n<p>I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance\\nfrom the house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those\\nof a drunken man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a\\nfilm covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of\\nfever. In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly\\nconscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as\\nif to seek something that I had lost.</p>\\n\\n<p>After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into\\nthe room where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women\\nweeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs;\\nall this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my\\nthoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my\\nmisfortunes and their cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder\\nand horror. The death of William, the execution of Justine, the\\nmurder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I\\nknew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the\\nmalignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under\\nhis grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea made me\\nshudder and recalled me to action. I started up and resolved to\\nreturn to Geneva with all possible speed.</p>\\n\\n<p>There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the\\nlake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents.\\nHowever, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to\\narrive by night. I hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I\\nhad always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily\\nexercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of\\nagitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion. I\\nthrew down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to\\nevery gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which\\nwere familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated\\nbut the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow\\nand a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had\\nceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they\\nhad done a few hours before; they had then been observed by\\nElizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and\\nsudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but\\nnothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend\\nhad snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature\\nhad ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is\\nsingle in the history of man. But why should I dwell upon the\\nincidents that followed this last overwhelming event? Mine has been\\na tale of horrors; I have reached their acme, and what I must now\\nrelate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends\\nwere snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is\\nexhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my\\nhideous narration. I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet\\nlived, but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore. I see him\\nnow, excellent and venerable old man! His eyes wandered in vacancy,\\nfor they had lost their charm and their delight&mdash;his\\nElizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that\\naffection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few\\naffections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed,\\ncursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and\\ndoomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the\\nhorrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence\\nsuddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few\\ndays he died in my arms.</p>\\n\\n<p>What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains\\nand darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,\\nindeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant\\nvales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in\\na dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\\nconception of my miseries and situation and was then released from\\nmy prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\\nunderstood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.</p>\\n\\n<p>Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\\nawakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the\\nmemory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on\\ntheir cause&mdash;the monster whom I had created, the miserable\\ndaemon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I\\nwas possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and\\ndesired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp\\nto wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.</p>\\n\\n<p>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began\\nto reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose,\\nabout a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in\\nthe town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew\\nthe destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his\\nwhole authority for the apprehension of the murderer. The\\nmagistrate listened to me with attention and kindness.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Be assured, sir,\" said he, \"no pains or exertions on my part\\nshall be spared to discover the villain.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I thank you,\" replied I; \"listen, therefore, to the deposition\\nthat I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I should\\nfear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\\nwhich, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too\\nconnected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for\\nfalsehood.\" My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but\\ncalm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my\\ndestroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an\\ninterval reconciled me to life. I now related my history briefly\\nbut with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy\\nand never deviating into invective or exclamation.</p>\\n\\n<p>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I\\ncontinued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him\\nsometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise,\\nunmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance. When I\\nhad concluded my narration I said, \"This is the being whom I accuse\\nand for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your\\nwhole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and\\nhope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution\\nof those functions on this occasion.\" This address caused a\\nconsiderable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor. He had\\nheard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a\\ntale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called\\nupon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his\\nincredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, \"I would\\nwillingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of\\nwhom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my\\nexertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can traverse\\nthe sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would\\nventure to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the\\ncommission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place\\nhe has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit,\\nand if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted\\nlike the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive\\nyour thoughts; you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to\\npursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.\" As I\\nspoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.\\n\"You are mistaken,\" said he. \"I will exert myself, and if it is in\\nmy power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\\npunishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you\\nhave yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\\nimpracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you\\nshould make up your mind to disappointment.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.\\nMy revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a\\nvice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my\\nsoul. My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom\\nI have turned loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just\\ndemand; I have but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my\\nlife or death, to his destruction.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a\\nfrenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty\\nfierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But\\nto a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas\\nthan those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much\\nthe appearance of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse\\ndoes a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of\\ndelirium.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Man,\" I cried, \"how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!\\nCease; you know not what it is you say.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to\\nmeditate on some other mode of action.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter 24</h2>\\n\\n<p>My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\\nswallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone\\nendowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and\\nallowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise\\ndelirium or death would have been my portion.</p>\\n\\n<p>My first resolution was to quit Geneva forever; my country,\\nwhich, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my\\nadversity, became hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money,\\ntogether with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and\\ndeparted. And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with\\nlife. I have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured\\nall the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous\\ncountries are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many\\ntimes have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and\\nprayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and\\nleave my adversary in being.</p>\\n\\n<p>When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by\\nwhich I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was\\nunsettled, and I wandered many hours round the confines of the\\ntown, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night approached I\\nfound myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William,\\nElizabeth, and my father reposed. I entered it and approached the\\ntomb which marked their graves. Everything was silent except the\\nleaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the\\nnight was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and\\naffecting even to an uninterested observer. The spirits of the\\ndeparted seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt\\nbut not seen, around the head of the mourner.</p>\\n\\n<p>The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly\\ngave way to rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their\\nmurderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary\\nexistence. I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with\\nquivering lips exclaimed, \"By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by\\nthe shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that\\nI feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside\\nover thee, to pursue the daemon who caused this misery, until he or\\nI shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will preserve\\nmy life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun\\nand tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish\\nfrom my eyes forever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and\\non you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in\\nmy work. Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony;\\nlet him feel the despair that now torments me.\" I had begun my\\nadjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that\\nthe shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion,\\nbut the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my\\nutterance.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and\\nfiendish laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains\\nre-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery\\nand laughter. Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by\\nfrenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow\\nwas heard and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died\\naway, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my\\near, addressed me in an audible whisper, \"I am satisfied, miserable\\nwretch! You have determined to live, and I am satisfied.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but\\nthe devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon\\narose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he\\nfled with more than mortal speed.</p>\\n\\n<p>I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided\\nby a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.\\nThe blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the\\nfiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the\\nBlack Sea. I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I\\nknow not how.</p>\\n\\n<p>Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded\\nme, I have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants,\\nscared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path;\\nsometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I\\nshould despair and die, left some mark to guide me. The snows\\ndescended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the\\nwhite plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and\\nagony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still\\nfeel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was\\ndestined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about\\nwith me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and\\ndirected my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate\\nme from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when\\nnature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was\\nprepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The\\nfare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate,\\nbut I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I\\nhad invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens\\ncloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim\\nthe sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.</p>\\n\\n<p>I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the\\ndaemon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population\\nof the country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were\\nseldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that\\ncrossed my path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of\\nthe villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food\\nthat I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always\\npresented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for\\ncooking.</p>\\n\\n<p>My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was\\nduring sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often,\\nwhen most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even\\nto rapture. The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments,\\nor rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to\\nfulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk\\nunder my hardships. During the day I was sustained and inspirited\\nby the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and\\nmy beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my\\nfather, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth\\'s voice, and beheld\\nClerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by a\\ntoilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night\\nshould come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my\\ndearest friends. What agonizing fondness did I feel for them! How\\ndid I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my\\nwaking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived! At such\\nmoments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I\\npursued my path towards the destruction of the daemon more as a\\ntask enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of\\nwhich I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul. What\\nhis feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed,\\nhe left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone\\nthat guided me and instigated my fury. \"My reign is not yet\\nover\"&mdash;these words were legible in one of these\\ninscriptions&mdash;\"you live, and my power is complete. Follow me;\\nI seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the\\nmisery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find\\nnear this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat\\nand be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our\\nlives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that\\nperiod shall arrive.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote\\nthee, miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up\\nmy search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I\\njoin my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for\\nme the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!</p>\\n\\n<p>As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows\\nthickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to\\nsupport. The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few\\nof the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom\\nstarvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey.\\nThe rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured;\\nand thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance. The\\ntriumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours.\\nOne inscription that he left was in these words: \"Prepare! Your\\ntoils only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we\\nshall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy\\nmy everlasting hatred.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing\\nwords; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on heaven\\nto support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse\\nimmense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed\\nthe utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the\\nblue seasons of the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be\\ndistinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness.\\nThe Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the\\nhills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils.\\nI did not weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my\\nguiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I\\nhoped, notwithstanding my adversary\\'s gibe, to meet and grapple\\nwith him.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs\\nand thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not\\nwhether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that,\\nas before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on\\nhim, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one\\nday\\'s journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he\\nshould reach the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed on,\\nand in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore. I\\ninquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained\\naccurate information. A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived\\nthe night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to\\nflight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his\\nterrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter food,\\nand placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a\\nnumerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same\\nnight, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his\\njourney across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they\\nconjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of\\nthe ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.</p>\\n\\n<p>On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of\\ndespair. He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and\\nalmost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean,\\namidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which\\nI, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to\\nsurvive. Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be\\ntriumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide,\\noverwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during\\nwhich the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to\\ntoil and revenge, I prepared for my journey. I exchanged my\\nland-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the frozen\\nocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed\\nfrom land.</p>\\n\\n<p>I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have\\nendured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just\\nretribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to\\nsupport. Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my\\npassage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which\\nthreatened my destruction. But again the frost came and made the\\npaths of the sea secure.</p>\\n\\n<p>By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should\\nguess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the\\ncontinual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often\\nwrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair\\nhad indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk\\nbeneath this misery. Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me\\nhad with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice\\nmountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the\\nexpanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark\\nspeck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to discover what it\\ncould be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a\\nsledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within.\\nOh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart! Warm tears\\nfilled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not\\nintercept the view I had of the daemon; but still my sight was\\ndimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that\\noppressed me, I wept aloud.</p>\\n\\n<p>But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of\\ntheir dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and\\nafter an hour\\'s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which\\nwas bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was\\nstill visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the\\nmoments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its\\nintervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when,\\nafter nearly two days\\' journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a\\nmile distant, my heart bounded within me.</p>\\n\\n<p>But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes\\nwere suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more\\nutterly than I had ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the\\nthunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath\\nme, became every moment more ominous and terrific. I pressed on,\\nbut in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the\\nmighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a\\ntremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a\\nfew minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I\\nwas left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually\\nlessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death. In this manner\\nmany appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself\\nwas about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw\\nyour vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of\\nsuccour and life. I had no conception that vessels ever came so far\\nnorth and was astounded at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of\\nmy sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with\\ninfinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your\\nship. I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to\\ntrust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my\\npurpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I\\ncould pursue my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took\\nme on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have\\nsunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still\\ndread, for my task is unfulfilled.</p>\\n\\n<p>Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the daemon,\\nallow me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?\\nIf I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you\\nwill seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare\\nto ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships\\nthat I have undergone? No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am\\ndead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should\\nconduct him to you, swear that he shall not live&mdash;swear that\\nhe shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to\\nthe list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent and persuasive, and\\nonce his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not. His\\nsoul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like\\nmalice. Hear him not; call on the names of William, Justine,\\nClerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and\\nthrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the\\nsteel aright.</p>\\n\\n<p>*</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Walton, in continuation.</b>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>August 26th, 17&mdash;</p>\\n\\n<p>You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do\\nyou not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even\\nnow curdles mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not\\ncontinue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing,\\nuttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine\\nand lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued\\nto downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes\\nhe commanded his countenance and tones and related the most\\nhorrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of\\nagitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would\\nsuddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked\\nout imprecations on his persecutor.</p>\\n\\n<p>His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the\\nsimplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and\\nSafie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen\\nfrom our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of\\nhis narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and\\nconnected. Such a monster has, then, really existence! I cannot\\ndoubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I\\nendeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his\\ncreature\\'s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable. \"Are\\nyou mad, my friend?\" said he. \"Or whither does your senseless\\ncuriosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the\\nworld a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do\\nnot seek to increase your own.\" Frankenstein discovered that I made\\nnotes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself\\ncorrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in\\ngiving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his\\nenemy. \"Since you have preserved my narration,\" said he, \"I would\\nnot that a mutilated one should go down to posterity.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the\\nstrangest tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every\\nfeeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest\\nwhich this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have\\ncreated. I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely\\nmiserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh,\\nno! The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his\\nshattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the\\noffspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams\\nhe holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion\\nconsolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that\\nthey are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves\\nwho visit him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives\\na solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as\\nimposing and interesting as truth.</p>\\n\\n<p>Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and\\nmisfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays\\nunbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His\\neloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he\\nrelates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of\\npity or love, without tears. What a glorious creature must he have\\nbeen in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and\\ngodlike in ruin! He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness\\nof his fall.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"When younger,\" said he, \"I believed myself destined for some\\ngreat enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a\\ncoolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements.\\nThis sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others\\nwould have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away\\nin useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow\\ncreatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a\\none than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could\\nnot rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But this\\nthought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now\\nserves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and\\nhopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to\\nomnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was\\nvivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by\\nthe union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the\\ncreation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect without passion my\\nreveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my\\nthoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of\\ntheir effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a\\nlofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known\\nme as I once was, you would not recognize me in this state of\\ndegradation. Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny\\nseemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.\"\\nMust I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend;\\nI have sought one who would sympathize with and love me. Behold, on\\nthese desert seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained\\nhim only to know his value and lose him. I would reconcile him to\\nlife, but he repulses the idea.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I thank you, Walton,\" he said, \"for your kind intentions\\ntowards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and\\nfresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are\\ngone? Can any man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another\\nElizabeth? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any\\nsuperior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess\\na certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can\\nobtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they\\nmay be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can\\njudge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the\\nintegrity of our motives. A sister or a brother can never, unless\\nindeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of\\nfraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he\\nmay be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with\\nsuspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and\\nassociation, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the\\nsoothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will\\nbe ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one feeling in\\nsuch a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were\\nengaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive\\nutility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But\\nsuch is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom\\nI gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may\\ndie.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>September 2nd</p>\\n\\n<p>My beloved Sister,</p>\\n\\n<p>I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am\\never doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that\\ninhabit it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no\\nescape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave\\nfellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look towards me\\nfor aid, but I have none to bestow. There is something terribly\\nappalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert\\nme. Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men\\nare endangered through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the\\ncause.</p>\\n\\n<p>And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not\\nhear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return.\\nYears will pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be\\ntortured by hope. Oh! My beloved sister, the sickening failing of\\nyour heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me\\nthan my own death.</p>\\n\\n<p>But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy.\\nHeaven bless you and make you so!</p>\\n\\n<p>My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion.\\nHe endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a\\npossession which he valued. He reminds me how often the same\\naccidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this\\nsea, and in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries.\\nEven the sailors feel the power of his eloquence; when he speaks,\\nthey no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and while they\\nhear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are\\nmole-hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man. These\\nfeelings are transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills them\\nwith fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair.</p>\\n\\n<p>September 5th</p>\\n\\n<p>A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although\\nit is highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I\\ncannot forbear recording it.</p>\\n\\n<p>We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent\\ndanger of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive,\\nand many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave\\namidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in\\nhealth; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is\\nexhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily\\nsinks again into apparent lifelessness.</p>\\n\\n<p>I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a\\nmutiny. This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my\\nfriend&mdash;his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging\\nlistlessly&mdash;I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who\\ndemanded admission into the cabin. They entered, and their leader\\naddressed me. He told me that he and his companions had been chosen\\nby the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a\\nrequisition which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured\\nin ice and should probably never escape, but they feared that if,\\nas was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free passage be\\nopened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them\\ninto fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this.\\nThey insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn\\npromise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct\\nmy course southwards.</p>\\n\\n<p>This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet\\nconceived the idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in\\njustice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated\\nbefore I answered, when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent,\\nand indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now\\nroused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with\\nmomentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said, \"What do you\\nmean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then, so easily\\nturned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious\\nexpedition?</p>\\n\\n<p>\"And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth\\nand placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers\\nand terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be\\ncalled forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death\\nsurrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome. For this\\nwas it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking. You\\nwere hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species,\\nyour names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death\\nfor honour and the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the\\nfirst imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and\\nterrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to\\nbe handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold\\nand peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to\\ntheir warm firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye\\nneed not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame\\nof a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be\\nmore than men. Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock. This\\nice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable\\nand cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not. Do not\\nreturn to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your\\nbrows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know\\nnot what it is to turn their backs on the foe.\" He spoke this with\\na voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his\\nspeech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can\\nyou wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another\\nand were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and\\nconsider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther\\nnorth if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped\\nthat, with reflection, their courage would return. They retired and\\nI turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and almost\\ndeprived of life.</p>\\n\\n<p>How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die\\nthan return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such\\nwill be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour,\\ncan never willingly continue to endure their present hardships.</p>\\n\\n<p>September 7th</p>\\n\\n<p>The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not\\ndestroyed. Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I\\ncome back ignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy\\nthan I possess to bear this injustice with patience.</p>\\n\\n<p>September 12th</p>\\n\\n<p>It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of\\nutility and glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to\\ndetail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while\\nI am wafted towards England and towards you, I will not\\ndespond.</p>\\n\\n<p>September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder\\nwere heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every\\ndirection. We were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only\\nremain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate\\nguest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely\\nconfined to his bed. The ice cracked behind us and was driven with\\nforce towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on the\\n11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free. When the\\nsailors saw this and that their return to their native country was\\napparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud\\nand long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked\\nthe cause of the tumult. \"They shout,\" I said, \"because they will\\nsoon return to England.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Do you, then, really return?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them\\nunwillingly to danger, and I must return.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your\\npurpose, but mine is assigned to me by heaven, and I dare not. I am\\nweak, but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me\\nwith sufficient strength.\" Saying this, he endeavoured to spring\\nfrom the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back\\nand fainted.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that\\nlife was entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he\\nbreathed with difficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave\\nhim a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In\\nthe meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours\\nto live.</p>\\n\\n<p>His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be\\npatient. I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and\\nI thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble\\nvoice, and bidding me come near, said, \"Alas! The strength I relied\\non is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and\\npersecutor, may still be in being. Think not, Walton, that in the\\nlast moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent\\ndesire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in\\ndesiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I have\\nbeen occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it\\nblamable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational\\ncreature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my\\npower, his happiness and well-being.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to\\nthat. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater\\nclaims to my attention because they included a greater proportion\\nof happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did\\nright in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature. He\\nshowed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed\\nmy friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed\\nexquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where\\nthis thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may\\nrender no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his\\ndestruction was mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish\\nand vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work,\\nand I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and\\nvirtue.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to\\nfulfil this task; and now that you are returning to England, you\\nwill have little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration\\nof these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your\\nduties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed\\nby the near approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I\\nthink right, for I may still be misled by passion.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs\\nme; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my\\nrelease, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several\\nyears. The forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten\\nto their arms. Farewell, Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and\\navoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of\\ndistinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Yet why do I\\nsay this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another\\nmay succeed.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted\\nby his effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards\\nhe attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand\\nfeebly, and his eyes closed forever, while the irradiation of a\\ngentle smile passed away from his lips.</p>\\n\\n<p>Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of\\nthis glorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to\\nunderstand the depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would\\nbe inadequate and feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by\\na cloud of disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may\\nthere find consolation.</p>\\n\\n<p>I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight;\\nthe breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again\\nthere is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from\\nthe cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise\\nand examine. Good night, my sister.</p>\\n\\n<p>Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy\\nwith the remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the\\npower to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be\\nincomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe. I entered\\nthe cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable\\nfriend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to\\ndescribe&mdash;gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in\\nits proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed\\nby long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in\\ncolour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the\\nsound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and\\nhorror and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision\\nso horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling\\nhideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to\\nrecollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I\\ncalled on him to stay.</p>\\n\\n<p>He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards\\nthe lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence,\\nand every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage\\nof some uncontrollable passion.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"That is also my victim!\" he exclaimed. \"In his murder my crimes\\nare consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its\\nclose! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does\\nit avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably\\ndestroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he\\ncannot answer me.\" His voice seemed suffocated, and my first\\nimpulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying\\nrequest of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by\\na mixture of curiosity and compassion. I approached this tremendous\\nbeing; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was\\nsomething so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to\\nspeak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to\\nutter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered\\nresolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his\\npassion.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Your repentance,\" I said, \"is now superfluous. If you had\\nlistened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of\\nremorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this\\nextremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"And do you dream?\" said the daemon. \"Do you think that I was\\nthen dead to agony and remorse? He,\" he continued, pointing to the\\ncorpse, \"he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not\\nthe ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the\\nlingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried\\nme on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the\\ngroans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to\\nbe susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to\\nvice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change\\nwithout torture such as you cannot even imagine.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland,\\nheart-broken and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted\\nto horror; I abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the\\nauthor at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments,\\ndared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness\\nand despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and\\npassions from the indulgence of which I was forever barred, then\\nimpotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable\\nthirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat and resolved that it\\nshould be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a\\ndeadly torture, but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse\\nwhich I detested yet could not disobey. Yet when she died! Nay,\\nthen I was not miserable. I had cast off all feeling, subdued all\\nanguish, to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth\\nbecame my good. Urged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my\\nnature to an element which I had willingly chosen. The completion\\nof my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And now it is\\nended; there is my last victim!\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet,\\nwhen I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of\\neloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the\\nlifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me.\\n\"Wretch!\" I said. \"It is well that you come here to whine over the\\ndesolation that you have made. You throw a torch into a pile of\\nbuildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and\\nlament the fall. Hypocritical fiend! If he whom you mourn still\\nlived, still would he be the object, again would he become the\\nprey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you\\nlament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from\\nyour power.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Oh, it is not thus&mdash;not thus,\" interrupted the being. \"Yet\\nsuch must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be\\nthe purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my\\nmisery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was\\nthe love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with\\nwhich my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated.\\nBut now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness\\nand affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what\\nshould I seek for sympathy? I am content to suffer alone while my\\nsufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that\\nabhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was\\nsoothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I\\nfalsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form,\\nwould love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of\\nunfolding. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and\\ndevotion. But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal.\\nNo guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found\\ncomparable to mine. When I run over the frightful catalogue of my\\nsins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts\\nwere once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the\\nbeauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen\\nangel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man\\nhad friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a\\nknowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which\\nhe gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of\\nmisery which I endured wasting in impotent passions. For while I\\ndestroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires. They were\\nforever ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship,\\nand I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be\\nthought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me?\\nWhy do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with\\ncontumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy\\nthe saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate\\nbeings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be\\nspurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood boils at\\nthe recollection of this injustice.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely\\nand the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and\\ngrasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other\\nliving thing. I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all\\nthat is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have\\npursued him even to that irremediable ruin.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but your\\nabhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on\\nthe hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which\\nthe imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when\\nthese hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my\\nthoughts no more.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My\\nwork is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man\\'s death is\\nneeded to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that\\nwhich must be done, but it requires my own. Do not think that I\\nshall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel\\non the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most\\nnorthern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile\\nand consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may\\nafford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would\\ncreate such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer\\nfeel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings\\nunsatisfied, yet unquenched. He is dead who called me into being;\\nand when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will\\nspeedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the\\nwinds play on my cheeks.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition\\nmust I find my happiness. Some years ago, when the images which\\nthis world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering\\nwarmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the\\nwarbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept\\nto die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes and torn\\nby the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom\\nthese eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert\\nyet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it\\nwould be better satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it\\nwas not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause\\ngreater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou\\nhadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against\\nme a vengeance greater than that which I feel. Blasted as thou\\nwert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of\\nremorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall\\nclose them forever.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"But soon,\" he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, \"I shall\\ndie, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning\\nmiseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile\\ntriumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames.

              " 'I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is forever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.',\n",
              " \"These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas' library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\",\n",
              " 'These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.',\n",
              " 'Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services. And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.',\n",
              " 'This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel. I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never. Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.',\n",
              " 'Your affectionate brother, R. Walton',\n",
              " 'Archangel, 28th March, 17—',\n",
              " 'To Mrs. Saville, England',\n",
              " 'How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.',\n",
              " 'But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathize with me, whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas\\' books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it) keeping; and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind. Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise. The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman\\'s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. \"What a noble fellow!\" you will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.',\n",
              " 'Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.',\n",
              " 'I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to \"the land of mist and snow,\" but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the \"Ancient Mariner.\" You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore. But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.']"
